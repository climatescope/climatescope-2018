In spring 2018, the team set out to research every non-OECD market with over 2 million inhabitants, plus Chile, Mexico and Turkey, which are defined as OECD countries but are among the most attractive emerging markets for clean energy. Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Yemen are not in the coverage due to local conflicts or international sanctions affecting them. The result is a country-level assessment of clean energy sector activity in 103 markets, up from 71 in 2017.</p>\n\n<p>The presence of demographic and economic giants Brazil, China, India and Nigeria in previous editions means that the change to the world GDP and population coverage of this year’s Climatescope is not as significant as the expansion in geographic coverage suggests. However, the inclusion for the first time of important clean energy markets such as Thailand, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates has led to jump in the share of global renewables asset finance covered from 50% to 63%.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"methodology\">Methodology</h2>\n\n<p>After six editions built around Climatescope’s original methodology conceived in 2011, and complemented with off-grid indicators from the 2014 edition on, we have made significant updates to the methodology for 2018. The main driver behind this decision is the transformation of the energy sector brought about by a renewables revolution.</p>\n\n<p>The clearest representation of how much the world has changed since 2011 is the 70% drop in the cost of Chinese-made PV modules. This in turn has transformed clean energy activity around the world. The 103 countries included in this year’s Climatescope installed 29GW of onshore wind in 2011, which was then a mature sector in some key markets like Brazil, but just 2GW of solar. This compares to 75GW of wind and 69GW of solar net capacity additions in 2017, the first year emerging markets installed more renewables than fossil capacity.</p>\n\n<p>This update also gave BNEF the opportunity to incorporate learnings from our last seven years of conducting research in emerging markets. The result is a more streamlined methodology, moving from four Parameters to three Topics:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Fundamentals. This Topic encompasses a country’s clean energy policies, power sector structure and regulation as well as any local barriers that might obstruct renewable energy development. A country with comprehensive and strong policies and a more liberalized power sector tends to be more welcoming to private investment than one with weaker frameworks and less liberalization. This Topic seeks to assess the fundamental structures that can help clean energy flourish.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Opportunities. This includes a country’s current and future electricity demand, its energy consumption, and its CO2 emissions from the power sector, along with overall price attractiveness, short- and medium term opportunities for renewable energy procurement, history of corporate commitment with sustainability and existing electrification rates.  This Topic seeks to encapsulate the future opportunities for clean energy growth available in a country.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Experience. This includes a country’s volume of installed clean energy, historical levels of renewable energy investment and the comprehensiveness of its non-manufacturing clean energy value chains. Markets with greater experience deploying renewable energy capacity typically offer lower risks, lower technology costs and lower costs of capital for investors.  This Topic seeks to reflect a country’s track record in successfully hosting clean energy development.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Aside from improving overall clarity, the main objective of the reorganization of indicators was to better isolate information on each country’s achievements to date. That information could then be better used to assess the country’s short- to medium-term potential.</p>\n\n<p>It is important to note that several key indicators are levelized against a country’s gross domestic product, population, installed capacity and generation. The methodology seeks to take into account and then discount the fact that some nations attract larger volumes of capital simply because they are bigger. The new methodology includes a total of 165 indicators and sub-indicators, down from 195 in 2017.</p>\n\n<p>Of the main changes made to indicators and their specific methodology, two deserve to be described in more detail:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Policy scores. In previous years, BNEF turned to an external panel of over 60 energy policy experts to review clean energy policies for countries. Each policy in each nation was assessed and scored by multiple experts. Those scores were then combined and blended with third-party indicators on a country’s political stability and level of corruption to produce a country’s overall policy score. As BNEF expanded Climatescope’s coverage to 103 nations and sought to deliver a more harmonized assessment of policy environments, the scoring of individual policies was taken in house. Each BNEF analyst who covered a country scored policies for that country based on their ambition, success in delivering renewables investment, stability, and ease of use by market participants. Analysts’ scores were then calibrated during a workshop where all involved in the report and senior staff discussed and, when necessary, adjusted scores.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>-Value chains. Climatescope 2018 no longer includes indicators associated with a country’s manufacturing value chain. This effectively acknowledges that clean energy manufacturing has reached such sufficient scale that some nations are now and likely to remain major producers and exporters, while others are primarily consumers/importers. In previous Climatescopes, the scores of small to medium-sized countries were effectively punished for lacking local manufacturing, regardless of whether establishing such value chains was practical. In fact, such countries may be making the wisest, most cost-effective decisions by procuring low-cost clean energy from elsewhere. We recognize that national governments continue to promulgate policies to support local clean energy manufacturing in the name of economic development.  We pass no judgement on whether those efforts have merit.  This year’s Climatescope methodology update on value chains is simply intended to recognize the globalized market as it stands today and reward countries that are taking the best steps to promote investment and deployment of renewables as quickly as possible.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"list-of-indicators-and-definition\">List of indicators and definition</h2>\n\n<p><strong>FUNDAMENTALS</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ambition of Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC): this indicator compares the objectives set out by governments in there NDC under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) with their historic emissions trend to evaluate the ambition of their emissions reduction goals.</p>\n\n<p>NDC target coverage: this indicator rewards countries based on the number of sectors that are covered by their emissions reduction goals.</p>\n\n<p>NDC target type: this indicators rewards countries that detail their emissions reduction goals in absolute terms the most, followed by those that use emission intensity targets.
