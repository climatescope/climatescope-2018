  "content": "<p>Fuelled by surging electricity demand and sinking technology costs, developing nations are today leading a global clean power transition. This marks a remarkable turnabout from a decade ago when the world’s wealthiest countries accounted for the bulk of renewable investment and deployment activity. Developing nations at the time were viewed as holding enormous promise only; wind, solar, geothermal and other clean technologies were regarded as too expensive for mass deployment.</p>\n\n<p>Last year’s Climatescope documented how the locus of clean energy activity had shifted noticeably from “North” to “South”, from OECD to non-OECD countries. This year’s survey goes one step further by illustrating how less developed nations are now very much driving the energy transition.</p>\n\n<p>Leadership is an elusive quality to quantify. Still, this year’s Climatescope offers compelling evidence that developing nations are at the forefront of change toward a cleaner-powered future. Consider:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>In 2017, the large majority of the world’s new clean power capacity was built in developing countries.</strong> A total of 114GW of zero-carbon capacity was added in these nations compared with approximately 63GW added in wealthier nations.</li>\n  <li><strong>In a first, renewables accounted for the majority of all new power-generating capacity added.</strong> Developing countries added 186GW in 2017 to their grids with wind and solar alone accounting for 94GW – just over half.</li>\n  <li><strong>Clean energy deployment is growing fastest in developing nations.</strong> New-build additions rose 20.4% year-on-year in these countries.  By contrast, new build in wealthier nations fell by 0.4%.</li>\n  <li><strong>Coal build has fallen sharply in developing countries.</strong> After peaking at 97GW of new capacity built in 2015, coal additions slipped to 48GW in 2017. New coal in India has crashed from 17GW per year 2012-16 to 4GW in 2017, suggesting the country is plotting a lower-carbon course to expand energy access.</li>\n  <li><strong>Developing countries are driving down clean energy costs, making these technologies more competitive with fossil generation.</strong> Over 35 emerging markets have held reverse auctions for clean power-delivery contracts to date, including Mexico ($21/MWh for PV) and India ($41/MWh; wind), procuring 140GW vs. 41GW in OECD countries. BNEF’s estimated levelized cost of electricity for wind and solar is below $50 for many developing nations.</li>\n  <li><strong>Clean energy investment is being deployed in more nations than ever.</strong> As of year-end 2017, 54 developing countries had recorded investment in at least one utility-scale wind farm and 76 countries had received financing for solar projects. That’s up from 20 and 3, respectively, a decade ago.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/graphics/content/key-findings/fig1-2.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Progress has of course been fueled by investment. In 2017, new clean energy financings in emerging markets totaled $143 billion. That was roughly level with 2016 and a far cry from the $178 billion 2015. However, it came against a backdrop of continued price drops for renewables technologies. A heterogeneous mix of funding sources have supported growth. Consider:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>The vast majority of clean energy capital deployed in emerging markets came from local sources.</strong> This was largely due to the heavy influence of domestic development banks and credit agencies in China and Brazil.</li>\n  <li><strong>Foreign direct investment (FDI) supporting clean energy rose to an all-time high.</strong> It jumped to $21.4 billion in 2017 from $13.9 billion in 2016.  EU-based sources provided the largest share at $9.6 billion, followed by the U.S. with $5.1 billion and Asia with $4.8 billion.</li>\n  <li><strong>Private capital is playing a growing role in clean energy FDI.</strong> While funding from development banks and export credit agencies remained flat from 2016 to 2017, funding from international utilities, project developers and commercial banks surged to $9.8 billion.</li>\n  <li><strong>The largest international funder of non-hydro renewables in developing nations over the last decade is Enel – by far.</strong> The Italian utility and independent power producer has provided $7.2 billion to projects mainly in Latin America. Other EU-based utilities have also been very active.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/graphics/content/key-findings/fig3-4.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>The progress achieved has been all the more impressive in light of rising U.S. interest rates, shrinking global liquidity, and a reduced appetite for international risk among some investors.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"project-updates\">Project updates</h3>\n<p>This year’s Climatescope Emerging Market Outlook represents the collective effort of 42 BloombergNEF analysts who made 54 country visits to collect data and conduct interviews. Once again, the study has been graciously supported by the U.K. Department for International Development.</p>\n\n<p>For 2018, the project has been expanded and updated in two key ways. First, the total number of countries surveyed was expanded significantly to 103. This includes 100 nations classified by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as less developed.  It also includes three countries – Chile, Mexico, and Turkey – that are an important part of the developing-nation story but are not technically classified as non-OECD. As a result of this expansion, Climatescope now offers a comprehensive snapshot of virtually all developing nations.</p>\n\n<p>Second, the Climatescope methodology has been streamlined and updated.  While the number of underlying data indicators remains approximately the same as last year at 165, these have now been grouped under three overarching Topics: Fundamentals, Opportunities, and Experience.  The weightings of underlying indicators as they count toward the overall score have also been updated slightly. Market conditions have changed dramatically since BNEF first conducted Climatescope seven years ago. These methodology updates are intended to make the data we have collected more accessible to users and the scoring system more reflective of current market realities.</p>\n\n<p>As in past years, Climatescope scored and ranked individual nations. While many of the countries that have appeared near the top of the survey’s leaderboard in years past are up there again this year, there are have been some notable changes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Chile is the top scorer in this year’s Climatescope survey.</strong> The Andean nation fared well on all three parameters thanks to strong government policies, a demonstrated track record of clean energy investment, and a commitment to de-carbonization despite grid constraints.</li>\n  <li><strong>India is the close second.</strong> The Indian market is home to the largest and most competitive auctions in the world, which contracted over 10.5GW from wind and solar in 2017 alone. The country aims to reach 175GW of clean energy capacity by March 2022, with 100GW coming from solar alone. The country’s solar market almost doubled in size in 2017, making it a record year with annual PV installations touching 8GW.</li>\n  <li><strong>Jordan is in third position.</strong> The country’s policy framework, clean energy targets, auctions, and renewable portfolio standard led to 730MW of wind and solar plants added 2015-2017. Jordan also has over 1GW of clean energy currently under construction.</li>\n  <li><strong>Brazil finished fourth, despite slumping clean energy investment and cancelled auctions.</strong> Brazil has pioneered competitive auctions to contract clean energy, which led to over 24.8GW of renewable energy contracted 2009-2017. With the worst of its economic crisis now behind it, clean energy appears poised for new growth.</li>\n  <li><strong>Rwanda rounds out the top five thanks to its unprecedented progress in expanding generation capacity and electrification over the last decade.</strong> Since 2010, approximatively 4.3 million of the country’s 11.8 million inhabitants have gained access to electricity.</li>\n  <li><strong>China remains critical to the global clean energy story but fell to seventh in the survey from top of the table last year.</strong> While China remains the largest market for clean energy build by far, curtailment issues and the halting of subsidies to solar generators dented its score. Climatescope’s updated methodology also places greater emphasis on countries’ openness to international investors over the availability of local manufacturing. While these changes contributed to China’s drop, its unrivaled clean energy investment and potential for de-carbonization ensured it remained in the survey’s top ten.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Despite successes achieved by clean energy to date in developing countries, it is far from certain these nations will de-carbonize their power sectors going forward. While new coal-fired capacity additions fell to their lowest level in over a decade in 2017, actual generation from coal-fired plants rose 4% year-on-year to 6.4TWh. Natural gas generation posted a similar 3% rise. And despite ample evidence that new-build renewables can underprice new-build coal-fired plants, 193GW of coal is currently under construction in developing nations today according to Coalswarm data, 86% of which is due to come online in China, India, Indonesia and South Africa.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, there is the longer-term challenge for clean energy to displace existing coal-fired plants. The question is particularly relevant for China and India, which get approximately two thirds and three quarters of their power from coal, respectively. Combined, these two countries added 432GW of coal capacity from just 2010-2017 (by comparison, the U.S. has a total of  260GW of coal on line today).  Faced with significant pressure to expand energy access (India) and keep power affordably priced (China), policy-makers will be reluctant to de-commission these relatively new plants anytime soon. And no less than 81% of all emerging market coal-fired capacity is located in these two nations alone.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/graphics/content/key-findings/fig5-6.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Finally, there is the fundamental question of how to accommodate large volumes of intermittent clean generation into existing power markets. As they require no fuel inputs, renewables projects operate at effectively zero marginal cost. Thus when they flood the grid in liberalized power markets, they can potentially decimate wholesale power prices for all generators.</p>\n\n<p>In the short run, this can hasten the demise of older, less efficient fossil plants and help keep CO2 emissions in check.  But when not properly managed, high clean energy penetration can de-stabilize markets, particularly if the clean output does not overlay neatly with electricity demand. Such situations can also result in clean energy projects becoming highly reliant on the goodwill of grid operators. In China, where over-capacity is acute in some regions for example, wind and solar projects have at times found their production curtailed in favor of coal-fired power plants.</p>\n\n<p>Developing nations are not alone in confronting the challenges posed by rising levels of clean power generation. Germany, other countries, and parts of the U.S. have all grappled with how to respond.  Among the options on the table: wholesale power market reforms to adjust incentives for generators; expanded demand-response programs to incentivize customers to reduce consumption at key hours; deployment of energy storage technologies such as batteries to extend the hours when clean electrons are available; or more transmission capacity to accommodate greater capacity from remote regions with the best wind or solar resources.</p>\n\n<p>Some developing countries are now actively seeking to implement these solutions. Brazil plans auctions to develop transmission lines into regions with strong natural resources. The World Banks’s Scaling Solar program in Madagascar’s includes incentives to build power storage and South Africa’s state-owned utility has stated an 800MWh storage goal for 2019.  Meanwhile, countries such as Algeria and Tajikistan have aggressively promoted the use of smart meters which are vital to demand-response programs.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, substantial additional work remains.  As clean energy costs continue to drop and deployment continues to rise, developing country grids must do more than match the sophistication of wealthier nations’ grids, but surpass it.  This will no doubt take concerted efforts, including further policy development, investment, and deployment of the newest technologies. But that also inevitably spells enormous opportunities for companies and financial institutions ahead.</p>\n"
