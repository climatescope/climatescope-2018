  "content": "<p>Climatescope is a unique country-by-country assessment, interactive report and index that evaluates the investment conditions for clean energy in emerging markets.\nIt profiles 103 markets worldwide and evaluates their ability to attract capital for low-carbon energy sources while building a greener economy.\nClimatescope is a snapshot of where clean energy policy and finance stand today, and a guide to what can happen in the future.</p>\n\n<p>This marks the seventh year of the Climatescope project. In 2012 and 2013, Climatescope focused exclusively on Latin America and the Caribbean. The first edition was developed by the Multilateral Investment Fund of the Inter-American Development Bank Group in partnership with BloombergNEF.\nFrom 2014 to 2016, the UK Department for International Development and the US Agency for International Development joined as supporters and advisors. The project was expanded to include 58 countries, states, and provinces in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. The coverage was expanded further to include three countries from the Middle-East and North Africa, as well as with an updated methodology for the off-grid energy coverage. In 2017, an additional 13 countries in Central Europe and Asia were added, bringing the total number of countries to 71.</p>\n\n<p>For 2018, the project has been expanded and updated in two key ways. First, the total number of countries surveyed was expanded significantly to 103. This includes 100 nations classified by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as less developed.  It also includes three countries – Chile, Mexico, and Turkey – that are an important part of the developing-nation story but are not technically classified as non-OECD. As a result of this expansion, Climatescope now offers a comprehensive snapshot of virtually all developing nations.</p>\n\n<p>This year’s Climatescope Emerging Market Outlook represents the collective effort of 42 BloombergNEF analysts who made 54 country visits to collect data and conduct interviews. Once again, the study has been graciously supported by the U.K. Department for International Development.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"project-director\">Project director</h3>\n\n<p>Ethan Zindler</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"project-manager\">Project manager</h3>\n\n<p>Dario Traum</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lead-analyst\">Lead Analyst</h3>\n\n<p>Luiza Demôro</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lead-modeller\">Lead Modeller</h3>\n\n<p>Ulimmeh Ezekiel</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"project-coordinator\">Project Coordinator</h3>\n\n<p>Misa Ichinose</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"communications-manager\">Communications Manager</h3>\n\n<p>Veronika Henze</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"editors\">Editors</h3>\n\n<p>Angus McCrone, Ben Vickers</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"research--data-gathering\">Research &amp; Data Gathering</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Africa and Middle East</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ian Berryman, Hugh Bromley, Justin Commerford, Bryony Collins, Emma Champion, Victoria Cuming, Michael Daly, Helen Dewhurst, David Doherty, Ulimmeh Ezekiel, James Frith, Chris Gadomski, Ines Goncalves, Kyle Harrison, Takehiro Kawahara, Thomas Knight, Eleonore Lazat, Cecilia L’Ecluse, Daniel McLaughlin, Roseline Pole, Katherine Poseidon, Dean Hope Robertson, Dario Traum, Antoine Vagneur-Jones</p>\n\n<p><strong>Asia</strong></p>\n\n<p>Nick Albanese, Richard Chatterton, Caroline Chua, Vandana Gombar, Shantanu Jaiswal, Maggie Kuang, Jonathan Luan, Jacqueline Lilinshtein, Fauzia Marzuki, Vertis McMillan, Colleen Regan, Abhishek Rohatgi, Divya Sehgal, Jane Swarbreck, Kirti Vasta, Mohit Velamala, Hanyang Wei</p>\n\n<p><strong>Europe</strong></p>\n\n<p>Julia Attwood, Tom Harries, Keegan Kruger, Nick Albanese, Ben Vickers</p>\n\n<p><strong>Latin America and Caribbean</strong></p>\n\n<p>Luiza Demôro, Laura Castro, Helena Chung, Rafael Borges da Silveira, James Ellis</p>\n\n<p><strong>Special thanks</strong></p>\n\n<p>Mike Reddaway, Serina Ng, Jon Moore, Dharshan Wignarajah, Sara Giordano, Yvette Osikilo, Nico Tyabji, Lilian Alves, Arlinda Mezini, Benjamin Kafri, Eve Ottlakan, Flow Bohl, Max Duluc, Noemi Glickman, Roshni Jaura, and the many energy sector stakeholders that our analyst teams met during research trips.</p>\n"
