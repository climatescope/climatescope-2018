energy policy","value":"The 2015 Energy Master Plan is the latest national energy plan. It envisions raising Myanmar’s generating capacity almost threefold to 15GW by 2030. Almost a third of the additional capacity would be new and repowered hydro generation; the rest would be supplied by installing 3GW of combined-cycle natural gas turbines, raising coal-fired capacity by 2.88GW from its present level of 120MW, and building 300MW of grid-connected solar, wind and geothermal projects from the present level of none. A National Electrification Project (NEP), which aims to bring electricity to all households by 2030, has been rolled out by the World Bank since early 2016. By the end of 2017, the country’s electrification rate reached 39%, up from about 37% in 2016. In September 2018, the new government led by Aung San Suu Kyi was reported to be drafting a renewable energy law which will target 8% renewables in total electricity generation by 2021, and 12% by 2025."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Solar is the main source of clean energy for Myanmar given the country’s geographic location, falling prices of solar panels and easy installation both on and off grid. Investment interest in solar projects surged under the previous government with developers proposing dozens of projects, but only one utility-scale solar project has made progress – Green Earth Power Thailand’s 220MW project that kicked off with the first phase of 40MW in 2017. The government’s perception of high cost and concerns of solar’s impact on grid stability have led to a halt in approving utility-scale solar projects. Heavily subsidized electricity tariffs make solar rooftops unattractive for many commercial and industrial users. Solar-plus-battery has been explored for off-grid applications, largely funded by the IFC-led Lighting Myanmar program. Recently, private capital has been flowing into the off-grid market lately propelled by the search for impactful investment returns."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Myanmar has some of the lowest electricity tariffs in the world, with $0.03/kWh for residential customers and $0.06-0.08/kWh for commercial and industrial users. In contrast, the recent negotiations with developers of LNG-to-power and solar projects indicate that cost of power generation on a levelized basis is no less than $0.095/kWh. The artificially low tariffs make market-rate power uncompetitive in Myanmar, and the cost of the subsidies makes it impossible for the government to fund new generation, transmission and distribution projects. The last tariff hike in Myanmar took place during the term of former President U Thein Sein. While the current government has mulled a further rise in tariffs since it took office, it has yet to implement an actual hike. The political sensitivity of a price increase has been cited as the main reason for the delay."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Myanmar only has 5GW of installed capacity as of 2017. Of this, 60% is hydro, 34% is gas and the remaining consists of biomass and coal. The government planned to transit to competitive bidding from traditionally bilateral negotiations in order to bring transparency and competition to the power market. In 2017, the Myingyan gas project was awarded via competitive bidding, the first in history. However, to expedite project development the government went back to bilateral negotiations with reputable developers via a special process called ‘Notice to Proceed’ at the beginning of 2018, and issued approvals for four LNG-to-power projects amounting to more than 3GW. The government is said to be still considering competitive bidding for the future, although there are questions about its capacity to implement such a program."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The Myanmar Companies Law, which came into effect in August 2018, is expected to attract an influx of foreign investment as it not only loosens foreign investment restrictions, but also sets up a one-stop online company registration platform to simplify the business registration process. Now the share of foreign holding is lifted to 65% maximum, so foreign capital can gain majority rights in a local company and own land for power project development. The Union Tax Law has exempted solar panels, charge controllers and inverters from commercial tax since 2016. The Myanmar Investment Law offers an import duty exemption to project developers that need to import their equipment, including solar modules and wind and gas turbines. In addition, corporate income tax breaks are set in different economic zones. There are three categories, developed, less developed and least developed in terms of their economy, that offer three, five and seven years of zero corporate income tax."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"A lack of institutional frameworks and governing capacity to implement policies and rules are the key barriers to scaling up project development. Currently, there is no legal framework or institutional system for granting PPAs. This does not encourage competition that is critical for driving down project cost. Another challenge is finance. Domestic banks are not able to provide finance for projects. The lending market is only just moving from an over-drafted loan market to a term loan market. In the past, all projects were financed by the government and/or multilateral concessional financing. The country’s power sector development is hampered by severe budgetary constraints and the non-existence of conventional commercial or project financing for power projects."}]}
