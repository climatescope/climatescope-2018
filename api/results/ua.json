energy policy","value":"Ukraine has set itself a target for renewables to account for 11% of generation by 2020. In support of this it has a generous feed-in tariff, tax incentives for the import of renewables-related equipment and a break on corporate tax for sales of electricity from renewable sources. Some regions such as Odessa even offer land under favorable conditions for renewables development. Still, the country is not on track to meet its 2020 target, with less than 2% of electricity generation coming from renewables in 2017. Ukraine’s new Electricity Law, which comes into full effect in July 2019, establishes a much clearer framework for the growth of renewables. The power markets are being reformed under this law, the role of the offtaker is clarified, and a framework for standard PPAs is established. All of this should boost investor confidence, which has been undermined by political instability over the past decade and following the annexation of Crimea and fighting in the east of the country."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy investments in Ukraine have been rising in the past few years, spurred by regulatory and legislative reforms that are increasing transparency. The biggest investments so far have been made by local developers, including Ukraine’s largest non-state utility DTEK, which is building the 200MW Primorskaya wind plant in the Zaporizhia Region. DTEK is also behind what will be Europe’s largest solar plant, the 246MW Nikopol plant in Dnipropetrovsk. China’s Trina Solar said in October 2018 it had delivered 123MW of panels for the plant. Foreign investors have also started testing the market. Acciona Energia began construction of the 55 million-euro, 57MW Dymerka solar project in 3Q 2018. Engie, which has reportedly been in discussions over a solar plant to be built in the Chernobyl nuclear plant exclusion zone, in 2017 became the first foreign company to gain a gas import license for Ukraine and appears to be concentrating its efforts in the gas sector. Finance is available from some local banks, such as Ukragazbank, but the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and other international institutions are the main source of funding, while U.S.-based OPIC has been offering insurance against political risk for some energy investments."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Power prices in Ukraine are regulated, and have been rising in preparation for the establishment of a wholesale market in 2019. More than half the country’s electricity generation in 2017 came from Ukraine’s mostly aged state-owned nuclear fleet, which effectively sells power at a subsidized rate. Both thermal and nuclear plants are in need of investment for renewal and life extension. It is unclear how this will be funded and how pricing will play out when the power market structure foreseen in the new Electricity Law comes into effect, which is expected for 2019. Power prices in the region are largely subsidized and are dependent on state-owned assets, or somewhat antiquated coal-fired power stations. Ukraine’s situation is further complicated by the shortfall in coal supplies from the east of the country that resulted from the 2014 war and the annexation of Crimea. Coal imports have partially compensated for this. Ukraine is currently debating a proposal to introduce auctions for renewables in 2019, which would bring market forces to bear on power pricing. The proposal faces opposition from developers currently operating in the market under the generous feed-in tariff system."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Nuclear plants supplied more than half the electricity generated in Ukraine in 2017 – a proportion that has increased in recent years. Nuclear has stepped in as coal-fired power plants have struggled to secure fuel supplies after the war in the east of the country and the annexation of Crimea. Renewables account for something less than 2% of generation – a proportion that is increasing, albeit still at a quite slow pace. Reforms under the new Electricity Law, which is effective from July 2019, will clarify the offtaker’s role and standardize PPAs, for which there is no commercial market at present. This will facilitate renewables developers’ access to the power market. The new law will establish a wholesale power market, an important step for IPPs to operate in the country. Generation is partially privatized, and DTEK is by far the largest single player there. Regional gas distribution is unbundled, yet the unbundling of state-controlled oil and gas company Naftogaz faces severe delays."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand in Ukraine, as for many of the former Soviet states, plunged after the collapse of the Soviet Union – and has not returned to prior levels. Industrial demand has not recovered, which has allowed for the current generation assets to serve the national market. The government’s drive to improve efficiency in housing and public buildings is expected to help limit increases in demand while renewables are developed. The aim is to lower Ukraine’s dependency on Russian gas for its power and heating needs. Electrification is 100%, as in most neighboring countries. The south of Ukraine has good solar resources, which has drawn investors to regions such as Odessa. Wind resources are also good – foreign equipment manufacturers have reportedly been mapping the wind resources to strengthen their case for selling to developers. Many of the coal and nuclear fleet need investment to modernize or extend their lifespan – as does the distribution and transmission system."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Ukraine now offers a premium on top of the feed-in tariff for the use of locally produced parts in renewables projects. There is, however, little in the way of local manufacturing. Imported equipment and goods for renewables projects is exempt from duties. There are restrictions on the use of agricultural land for renewables projects and on the production of bioethanol by foreign companies.  There are some untested rules around the ownership of strategically important energy assets by foreign companies. Probably of greater concern is the level of political risk – although this has been declining, investors still face financing issues because of perceptions of instability in the country, even though the trend in Ukraine is toward more transparency. Currency risk has also been a barrier to renewables deployment. The administrative burden on foreign companies is still more onerous than for local companies. There is no curtailment risk in Ukraine, but grid connections are still obtained through variable procedures."}]}
