energy policy","value":"While Benin has no clean-energy policies in place, February 2018 saw the creation of the UC/PDER, the so-called Entity in Charge of Renewable Energy Policy Development. This is attached to the presidency and will draft the country’s renewable energy law and structure the sector over the coming 18 months. In parallel, the U.S. Millennium Challenge Account II is on a four-year mission to help the Beninese government develop a new energy framework for the country. MCA II plans to increase local electricity generation by 46MW, reducing energy dependence. The program also aims to modernize distribution infrastructure by building new sub-stations, upgrading to higher voltage and building new lines. Finally, the program is driving off-grid electrification efforts."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"While Benin has attracted no clean energy investment from commercial sources to date, international and national concessional finance have been committed to the Millennium Challenge Account II program. The U.S., the main benefactor of the MCA II, has donated $375 million. The Benin government has contributed another $28 million on top of that. This funding will go toward the development of four solar PV projects: two 15MW plants in Bohicon and Parakou, 10MW in Djougou, and another 5MW plant in Natitingou are planned. On top of new solar developments, the program hopes to restore the Yéripao Dam and install a second turbine to increase production to 1MW."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Benin’s electricity prices are comparable to those in neighboring Togo. Overall, prices have decreased over the past couple of years, due to currency fluctuations rather than a change in tariffs (they haven’t changed since 2010). There is talk of raising the tariffs in 2019 as new local electricity production is more expensive than existing imports."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Benin relies on thermal generation, with a heavy dependence on its neighbors. While the country has virtually no renewable energy projects to date, the planned PV plants will help Benin reduce energy dependence. Policies and regulation linked to renewables have not been elaborated yet, so uncertainty on their status and market priority remains. Benin’s power sector is partially unbundled. Generation is separated from transmission and retail, though very few players have entered the space due to the lack of financing available to date."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The MCA II program sets Benin on a good track to develop the energy sector. The aim of the program is to reinforce the energy sector and hopefully see spillover effects into other sectors spurring economic activity.  The country has substantial off-grid electrification potential, as only 7% of the rural population has access to electricity. The OCEF, subsidiary of the MCA II, has set up a fund for off-grid electrification. The first call for proposals closed in May, and a shortlist of projects was published in September 2018."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The small size of the Benin energy sector is a limit in itself. Since there have been no large-scale projects to date, the energy value chain is limited. The lack of regulation or previous projects means that the process for project development and bureaucracy are unclear.  Though slow policy development is a hurdle to project development, Benin has no particular political risks, currency volatility or offtaker risk."}]}
