In 2017 alone, the regulator increased the tariffs for both the commercial and residential bands by approximately 34%. Industrial prices saw a marginal decrease over the same period, falling from $41.97 to $41.53/MWh. Social tariffs, which apply to low-income users, have remained stable. Like most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Mozambique does not have a wholesale power market, but it does belong to the Southern Africa Power Pool, which is gradually increasing liquidity."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The power sector consists predominantly of hydroelectric generation, representing 85% of the capacity mix in 2017. However, this mix is expected to change in the future following large discoveries of coal and offshore gas. No large-scale wind or PV plants have been commissioned to date. Mozambique’s power market is currently structured around Electricidade de Moçambique (EDM), a state-owned and vertically integrated utility responsible for the transmission, distribution and sale of electricity. EDM oversees 20% of the country’s generating capacity, but purchases power produced by IPPs and the 2.1GW Cahora Bassa Hydro (HCB). The latter is majority owned by the Mozambican state (92.5%). 90% of the plant’s generation is exported, mostly to South Africa."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Progress in extending electricity access to the wider population has been slow. As it stands, only 29% of the population is electrified. But power demand has been growing at pace, with peak consumption tripling since 2010. For on-grid projects, EDM has signed PPAs with IPPs. However, these are negotiated on a case-by-case basis but are usually long-term, with the duration of tenors starting at 20 years."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"In addition to the lack of renewables incentives, developers face a difficult investment environment: the country came in 135th place on the World Bank’s ease of doing business index. There is currently no standardized PPA duration outlined for either utility-scale or off-grid projects. Moreover, offshore gas discoveries have rendered renewables less attractive. The lack of PPA standardization has meant that negotiations with EDM can be drawn out. The national utility is also in flux, with major structural and operational changes under way, in addition to being laden with debts. Private investors have complained that project development is often hindered by the state electricity company’s internal politics."}]}
