energy policy","value":"Albania meets its electricity demand through a combination of domestic generation and imports. The level of imports depends on the annual hydrological cycle as Albania generates 100% of its electricity from large and small hydro power plants. Via a Renewable Energy Law that entered into force in 2017, it intends to incentivize new renewable capacity -- wind, solar and small hydro -- through granting feed-in tariffs for small projects and holding auctions for larger projects. It held its first auction in September 2018 for 50MW of solar – plus an obligation for the winner to build an additional 20-50MW unsubsidized. But there is no transparency on the timing, number or capacity of future auctions."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Most investment in clean energy over the last five-years has gone into small hydro projects. It is difficult to estimate the exact share of foreign investment, but the majority of projects are built by local developers. The exception is the 73MW Banje power station, which is owned and funded by Statkraft, the Norwegian utility. The market for clean energy is open to foreign investment and it is likely that any future large-scale wind or solar projects will attract foreign investors. To date, international concessional financing has been key for clean energy projects, specifically small hydro. Concessional finance has also helped projects raise debt finance from domestic and international commercial banks, such as Italy's Intesa and Austria’s Raiffeisen."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Residents and small- to medium-sized commercial enterprises are eligible to receive a regulated electricity tariff. Since receiving a World Bank loan in 2014 to reform the power sector, the distribution system operator, OSHEE, has eradicated the two-tier pricing system for households in 2015 so households play a flat fee per kilowatt-hour. Then it simplified the commercial rates, so users pay a flat rate, depending on whether it is using 35, 20, or 10kV electricity. The tariffs are re-stated annually, while OSHEE is under pressure from the World Bank's loan covenants to reduce its debt burden, potentially by increasing prices. There is no power exchange in Albania (although there are plans for a joint exchange with Kosovo by the end of 2018), which means large consumers of electricity negotiate prices bilaterally with suppliers."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Transmission and generation are separated into two distinct companies: KESH for generation, and OST for transmission. Acceptance into ENTSO-E, the European network of TSOs, is pegged to verification that OST is an unbundled TSO. However, retail and distribution are still combined under one distribution system operator, OSHEE. This entity missed the end of 2017 unbundling deadline, set in the 2015 Power Sector Law. In 2018, the government announced plans to break up OSHEE into three distinct companies: retail, distribution and service provider. There are some private players in generation and plans for more."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Albania has already reached 100% electrification but the power system can be unreliable. In periods of low water reserves, the system relies on the distribution system operator, OSHEE, to tender for energy imports to cover the shortfall and meet its customers' demands (OSHEE supplies the regulated tariff customers). In 2017, the system was tight because levels were so low that in order to afford the energy imports, state-owned utility KESH had to make an emergency draw-down on a loan provided by the World Bank for reforming the electricity sector. As a result, the government is looking to diversify its electricity mix through adding solar and wind. It has also outlined a plan to incentivize net-metering for systems up to 500kW, covering households and small- to medium-sized commercial enterprises."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The biggest barrier to new renewable capacity is offtaker risk. As part of the power sector reform the distribution system operator and supplier of electricity for regulated tariff customers, OSHEE, will act as the offtaker for new renewable projects. It is currently undergoing a reform, using a loan from the World Bank, to reduce its debt burden. At fault are low tariffs, electricity theft, and technical losses in the distribution system. OSHEE's perilous financial position means there is high offtaker risk and any PPA will most likely be signed in conjunction with one or several government or World Bank guarantees. Proposed PPAs are for 15 years and, in 2018, grid codes for connecting to the transmission and distribution grids were adopted. The Renewable Energy Law details that generators are responsible for the cost of connecting to the grid, while the grid operator is responsible for any costs needed to strengthen the grid as a result of the new capacity."}]}
