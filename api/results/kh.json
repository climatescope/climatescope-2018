energy policy","value":"Cambodia has few clean energy policies in place today, and there are no incentives such as feed-in tariffs or net metering. With much of its infrastructure destroyed during the country’s civil war in the 1970s, the government and its utility (Electricite du Cambodge, or EDC) has instead set ambitious goals to electrify all villages by 2020, and 70% of all households by 2030. The Asian Development Bank has been working with EDC to help launch a pilot solar auction to procure 100MW; however, it is not a formal program and it is unclear if and when the auction will go forward."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Like its neighbor Laos, Cambodia has directed power-sector investment toward large hydro and coal-fired power plants, as well as transmission and distribution, to support its electrification target. One 10MW solar plant has been built to date, by a Singaporean company with concessional finance support from the Asian Development Bank and the Canadian Climate Fund. There are few Cambodian banks or other financial institutions with the ability to support renewable energy projects at present, although some small banks, with assistance from Japanese parent companies, are hoping to increase the availability of domestic financing with capacity building."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Cambodia’s consumers pay some of the highest retail electricity rates in the region, at $0.15/kWh for most residential consumers. These tariffs have declined by roughly one-third since 2010, as the government has sought to make power more affordable at the same time that it connects more villages to the grid. Tariffs are not cost-reflective but are subsidized by the government, which covers losses faced by electricity distributors. Because of their focus on rapid electrification and lowering costs, EDC and the government have favored large power plants with low per-megawatt costs, such as hydro and coal. Solar costs are coming down, however: Sunseap’s 10MW project reportedly cost $0.09/kWh, while a recent contract for a 60MW PV plant came in around $0.07-0.08/kWh, rendering it competitive, or nearly so, with coal-fired units."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Cambodia’s power market is dominated by EDC, a utility that controls most of the grid and retails power to all grid-connected consumers. Nearly all of the generators are owned by independent power producers, which are able to sell to EDC only via a special license. In remote areas of the country, electricity is supplied by hundreds of private operators that generate, deliver and sell power; however, these operators lose their licenses to generate power as soon as the national grid arrives. Over 90% of grid-supplied power in Cambodia is generated by large hydro and coal-fired plants. Most of these units have been built since 2012, with the overall stack quadrupling as Cambodia sought to wean itself off imports as demand boomed."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The government’s aggressive electrification program has raised the share of households with access to electricity from only 22% in 2010 to a reported 70% in 2017, boosting demand for power threefold. Electricity quality remains an issue in remote areas, but opportunities for off-grid companies are thin: the government is not transparent about grid extension plans, and off-grid systems are unable to feed into the grid once it arrives, effectively stranding these assets. Many companies formerly specializing in solar home systems have shifted focus to work on commercial and industrial sites, where there is more opportunity."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The absence of regulatory clarity is a significant obstacle to renewable energy development in Cambodia. Recently, EDC proposed a new rate structure to allow for grid-connected, small-scale solar at commercial and industrial sites, but the rate’s capacity charge is essentially workable only for very large facilities that run round-the-clock. Many expect the tariff to be adjusted, but there is little urgency on EDC’s side. For utility-scale renewables, it can be difficult to obtain a generation license, which is required to export power to the grid; at the same time, EDC has little experience with PPAs for intermittent resources and is not eager to incorporate them into the system."}]}
