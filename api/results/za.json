energy policy","value":"Once the benchmark of success, South Africa's renewables auction program is recovering from nearly three years of policy stalemate. The pause came to an end in April 2018 when the new Energy Minister Jeff Radebe signed the power-purchase agreements for the 27 outstanding renewable energy projects from Rounds 3.5-4. So far 6.4GW of renewables capacity across 102 projects has won support through the scheme and the next round is scheduled for 4Q 2018, with 1.8GW on offer. Future plans will likely be driven by the updated Integrated Resource Plan, which outlines the country’s planned generating capacity and was sent back to the Cabinet in March 2018 for “reprocessing”. Contentious issues include more nuclear power capacity; and limits for renewables technologies. In fossil fuels, the government has plans to procure more coal and gas capacity through dedicated IPP programs."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy investment in South Africa has risen and fallen with the rounds of its auction program, with particularly high totals in years when winning projects had to reach financial close. In total, it attracted $16.7 billion over 2004-17 but that last four years have averaged just $1.4 billion each, as the auction scheme was on standby. Two-thirds of the 2004-17 total was spent on solar projects, with the solar thermal projects commanding a per-megawatt capex more than its PV cousin. South Africa has the most diverse mix of investor types in the region where typically renewables projects rely on concessional financing. Of the $15 billion of asset finance since 2004, 45% has come from (in particular, local) commercial banks and another 8% from private equity."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"The winning tariffs have dropped significantly in each renewables auction: wind and PV fell 24% and 29% between Rounds 3 and 4, after adjusting the tariffs for factors such as inflation and merchant tail. Overall, the LCOE for onshore wind in South Africa – at $64-95/MWh – falls in the middle of our benchmark estimates in 1H 2018, as its relatively low capex is counteracted by higher financing costs. It's a similar story for PV (without tracking), with an LCOE of $63-69/MWh. As is common in the region, South Africa has no wholesale electricity market and the energy regulator (Nersa) decides the retail prices. Eskom has repeatedly argued for substantial tariff increases to claw back its billions of expenses. Overall, tariffs climbed an average of 13.7% a year over 2004-17."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Eskom, the state-owned utility, dominates the power sector. Independent generators have started to capture generation market share, mostly renewables, and municipalities are responsible for retail of electricity in some areas. (The customer still has no choice of supplier.) The country regularly exports electricity to its neighbors through the Southern African Power Pool. South Africa saw some short-term load shedding (scheduled power cuts) in June 2018 – its first episode since 1H 2016; but this is a far cry from the height of regular load shedding in 2014-15. Coal dominates South Africa's electricity mix, accounting for nearly 80% of capacity in 2017. This share is likely to be maintained once the Medupi and Kusile coal plants (at 4.8GW each) come online together with the government's IPP program."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The main opportunity for off- or mini-grid projects in South Africa is in rural areas where electrification was at 66% in 2017, compared with 93% in urban areas. The Integrated National Electrification Plan includes initiatives to boost electricity access in rural areas; aims to fund an estimated 723,000 grid and 49,650 non-grid connections to households by 2019/20. Electricity consumption in South Africa has stagnated in recent years, declining 0.5% a year on average since 2006. The reduction has been most felt by heavy power users due to factors including economic slowdown, volatility in commodity markets and rising electricity costs. This trend has been reflected in peak demand, which decreased by a compound annual growth rate of 0.44%."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Investors remain wary of future policy stalemates as well as the offtaker – Eskom – which is now even more financially beleaguered and has yet to demonstrate its support for renewables. Its financial woes continue amid weak power demand, non-payment by municipalities and governance issues. Even though the change of administration bodes well for renewables, there remain vocal opponents to what they label as \"expensive\" technologies. Tariffs in forthcoming renewables auction rounds may increase as the government imposes tougher local content requirements and there is dwindling space on the grid with good resource potential. One barrier to roofotp PV is the lack of approved mandatory process to govern small-scale embedded generation connecting to the grid."}]}
