energy policy","value":"Uganda failed to meet its ambitious clean energy targets for 2017, but generation capacity in the country has still grown by over 50% since 2010. There is also a pipeline of over 1GW of hydro projects in development. The biggest catalyst of growth in the country’s generation capacity has been the successful renewable energy feed-in tariff (REFiT), which offered attractive prices over 20-year contracts to hydro, biomass, wind and, most recently, solar developers. REFiT has since run out of funding, but tax incentives, while sometimes lacking in transparency, and a universal electricity access goal by 2035 are enough to put Uganda ahead of many of its neighbors as a clean energy investment hotspot."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Steady growth in both the on-grid and off-grid markets in Uganda has led to consistent clean energy investment. A myriad of development banks, foundations, private equity funds, local banks and impact funds, both domestic and international, have boots on the ground. Most of this investment has gone into hydro projects, with over 700MW commissioned to date and an additional 1GW of projects in the pipeline. Investment in the off-grid solar market has increased dramatically as well: through 2017, 270,000 solar home systems have been distributed in Uganda. Engie’s acquisition of Uganda’s largest off-grid solar player, Fenix International, at the end of 2017 emphasizes strong investor appetite in the country from big name foreign players."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Uganda has high retail electricity prices relative to its East Africa neighbors, due to a slew of renewable projects locked into ‘take-or-pay’ contracts at prices that were once considered cost-competitive. The de-facto utility in the country, Umeme, guarantees its shareholders a 20% return on investment, which has had a further ripple effect on prices, even with heavy subsidies. Commercial and residential retail prices have increased 75% since 2010 to roughly $170/MWh, while industrial prices have more than doubled to $100/MWh over the same period. Strong hydro and solar resources in the region will make both technologies the focus of Uganda’s energy sector moving forward, which should help to bring electricity prices down."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Uganda’s power market has been liberalized since 2001. State-owned Uganda Electricity Generation Company Ltd. competes with private players in the generation market, which is dominated by hydro (709MW), biomass (76MW) and solar (20MW). Hydro makes up the entire project pipeline, but an oversupply in generation has stalled additional project approvals, and the country is investigating opportunities to export electricity to neighboring countries. Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Ltd. has full ownership of transmission in the country, while Uganda Electricity Distribution Company Ltd. owns all distribution concessions, tendering them out to private players. Publicly-listed Umeme has won over 90% of these concessions. The Electricity Regulatory Authority looks over all of these segments, and is the most dynamic entity in Uganda’s power market."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Due to an excess of power plants connected to the grid, the generation market in Uganda is in a holding pattern. On-grid, most investment opportunity lies in strengthening and expanding the transmission and distribution network. A number of development banks, including the World Bank and KfW, have already contributed to ongoing projects in these areas, but more support is required if the country is to meet a universal electricity access target by 2035. Rural electricity is just as essential, and Uganda has a thriving off-grid solar market, with dozens of companies using pay-as-you-go and mobile money models to great success. The maturity of this segment of the market is demonstrated by the flow of investment from financial institutions."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Being a landlocked country, Uganda must import components via overland shipping from the port of Mombasa, Kenya – an expensive and time-consuming endeavor. While many of these components are VAT-exempt, there remains a lack of clarity of what constitutes exemption and what doesn’t. Uganda is also rife with corruption: many donor agencies have tightened the reins on investment or established more stringent targets that the Ministry of Energy & Mines and other state-owned players need to hit to activate further funding. Umeme remains both a credible and well-run company, but uncertainty around its ability to renew its distribution concessions in 2025 will fuel investor apprehension in the coming years."}]}
