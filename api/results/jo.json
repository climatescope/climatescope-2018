energy policy","value":"Jordanâ€™s National Energy Strategy plan aims for the country to generate 10% of its energy needs by 2020 from renewable sources. Since launching, the plan has already seen 730MW of renewable projects come into operation, with 1036MW under construction and a further 150MW under financial close. To date, two rounds of direct proposals have been completed and a third is under way. Despite delays due to grid capacity constraints and the introduction of a 35% local content requirement in round three, stable policies and transparent incentives have allowed Jordan to become a regional leader in renewable energy."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Wind and solar have been the focus of renewable investment to date with 533MW of solar and 197MW of wind currently operational. The government is launching a 30MW battery storage project and has requested proposals for its development by the end of 2018. It has targeted a further 70MW of battery storage capacity pending the outcome of the project. Traditionally international development banks have provided financing for renewable projects, however, an increasing number of domestic banks and private equity funds are active in the market. As such, financing for renewable projects in Jordan is both well established, and the process of securing finance is less onerous than elsewhere in the region."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Prices for consumers in Jordan are subsidized. Commercial consumers have traditionally paid the highest electricity prices, subsidizing residential consumers. This led to a rise in wheeling projects and the loss of high-paying commercial customers. Wheeling projects have thus been discouraged and prices for commercial consumers lowered slightly, while prices for households were increased. This has not stemmed financial losses at state-owned National Electric Power Co. (Nepco), which is already heavily indebted, and as a result electricity prices across sectors continue to rise."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Fossil fuels account for 84% of generation capacity in Jordan, followed by 12% from solar and 4% from wind. Capacity additions will accelerate in coming years with the commissioning of projects from the first rounds of direct proposals. Distinct bodies exist in the sector for production, transmission and distribution. There are separate companies for generation and distribution while transmission is the responsibility of Nepco. There is no wholesale generation market and Nepco purchases all generated electricity. Nepco has a template wind and solar PPA that currently exposes them to deemed energy compensation. Jordanian power prices are not market driven as generators cannot sell directly to the distributors and the government subsidizes tariffs."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Despite demand for power slowing in 2016 and 2017 due to a slowdown in the economy, the outlook for power demand in Jordan remains strong. The government expect high population growth combined with an expanding commercial and industrial sector to boost power demand to over 5.8GW by 2025, from 3.3GW in 2017. The majority of Jordanians live in the north of the country surrounding the capital Amman, and 99.9% of the population have access to power."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Jordan introduced a 35% local content requirement for solar and wind projects in 2018. The requirement applies to the total value of each project. The solar sector in Jordan is well established, with multiple local firms capable of producing panels, cables and steel structures for solar projects. However, wind projects are likely to struggle to meet the 35% threshold, as there are no major component manufacturers in Jordan. All equipment used in renewable energy projects are exempt from import and sales tax. The National Energy Strategy also provides a 100% exemption from income tax over 10 years for independent power producers generating renewable energy. The tax break incentivizes private sector investment in renewables and receives backing from project developers."}]}
