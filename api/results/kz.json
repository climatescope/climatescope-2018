energy policy","value":"Kazakhstan has a massive potential for renewables and sufficient land for wind/solar installations. The country aims for its renewable energy capacity to reach 30% by 2030 and 50% by 2050, as specified in the presidential edict and the EXPO2017 hosted in the capital Astana. The principal incentive is the generous feed-in-tariff (denominated in local currency) introduced for each of the technologies such as hydro, wind, solar and biofuel. Tax exemptions are available. It has laid the foundation for private and foreign investors in the renewable energy sector for years, before Kazakhstan started operation of an auction mechanism in May 2018. This new mechanism, the largest one in Central Asia, may bid down the wholesale prices for renewables projects."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"While Kazakhstan introduced the feed-in tariff in 2009, clean energy investment only really kicked off four years later. In total, it attracted $960 million between 2013 and 1H 2018. The country is looking forward to several major new projects in both solar and wind in order to meet its 20-50% target, potentially indicating that investment may rise in coming years. However, the Kazakh market faces a lack of liquidity in the aftermath of the financial crisis, and energy financing typically comes from international concessional or commercial sources. Local interest rates are above 12%."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Retail electricity tariffs in Mongolia range from 12-15 tengi a kWh for various types of user. The years of reducing tariffs means it is now cheaper than its neighbors such as Mongolia and China. This level has been kept relatively low, because the operating cost for general thermal generators (typically built in the Soviet Union times and using old technologies) can be lower than 10 tengi a kWh. By comparison, the feed-in tariff stands at 22.86 tengi for wind, 34.61 tengi for solar, 16.71 tengi for hydro and 32.23 tengi for biofuel. Even in the auctioning market in 2018, the resulting tariffs are still significantly higher than the retail power prices, creating challenges for the competitiveness of renewables."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Fossil fuels account for 86% of Kazakhstan’s installed generating capacity and approximately 90% of generation in 2017. This may change as the high-polluting Soviet-funded coal plants age, and more renewables are deployed, given the significant land and outstanding wind/solar resources. The country imports some electricity from Russia in its western part, but not significantly elsewhere. Fossil fuel new build is essentially on hold, except for an expansion of the Ekibastuz plant; renewable energy, despite slow growth in 2017, still has a number of wind/solar projects in the pipeline and will likely see a wave of new build by 2020. The existing renewables projects are prioritized in dispatch and little curtailment happens. The grid (KEGOC) is state-owned, while generation and retail sides allow the private sector; large power users can choose from which power supply companies to buy electricity although this does not apply to residential customers. The state’s Financial Settlement Center (FSC) is the only offtaker for renewables."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Kazakhstan could supply wind power of 1.8TWh and solar of 3.76TWh annually. Power demand has increased in recent years, at an approximate annual rate of 3.4%. It was slightly faster, growing at around 4% and reaching over 16,500MW in 2017, because the country placed more resources on the development of its new capital city for the EXPO2017. Kazakhstan is also the largest power market in Central Asia. There is potential for off-grid development (such as solar) in remote areas of the country, although access to power is no longer a significant challenge to Kazakhstanis. More importantly, as the Soviet-era coal-fired power fleet is getting older (mostly aged over 40 years) and in desperate need of refurbishment, Kazakh renewables could be in a position to replace some of the existing capacity."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The greatest challenge for renewables investors is how to finance a project, given the lack of liquidity in local banks and limited loan maturity. Local banks that are not experienced in renewables will likely require a 12-15% interest rate on loans denominated in the local currency, with a 4-5-year tenor – much too short for a typical renewable energy project. There is also currency risk, considering that tengi (KZT) depreciated from $0.0083 in 2008 to $0.0031 in 2017. Shipping of wind turbines and solar PV requires land transport, pricier than marine shipping. Apart from issues related to financing and costing, some developers in the country have also encountered small barriers in terms of land preparation and technical adaptation. Some delays of permitting and engineering should be expected."}]}
