energy policy","value":"Since 2016, Serbia has offered a feed-in tariff to support wind, solar, biomass, biogas, hydro and geothermal. The feed-in tariff has been high enough to trigger capacity additions, but there are technology caps, to curb excessive build-out and ensure a manageable subsidy budget. Solar caps will be reached, albeit thanks to a low limit of 4MW for rooftop solar and 6MW for ground-mounted installations. Meanwhile, the larger wind cap, at 500MW is also expected to be met: 50% has already closed financing and the remaining 50% is expected to follow and be commissioned by 2020."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Over the last five years, when excluding small hydro, renewables capacity has grown at a CAGR of 44%. The majority of this is thanks to the financing of large-scale wind farms, sourced from domestic banks, foreign banks and money from impact funds. One of the biggest investors in Serbia's clean energy sector is MK Fintel – a joint venture between Serbia's MK Group and Italy's Fintel Energia – and it is expected to build around 60% of the country's 500MW wind capacity target. Beyond traditional energy players, the country's wind sector has also attracted financing from Masdar, a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi's Mubadal Investment Co., where it bought a 60% stake in the 158MW under-construction Cibuk 1 wind farm."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Commercial, retail, and industrial power price reforms were introduced in 2015. Previously, tariffs were set below the cost-recovery point for the state utility, EPS. The reforms also helped Serbia align with the EU's accession requirements. For end-users, it meant a 30% increase in tariffs in 2016, and a further 2% in 2017. Serbia's feed-in tariffs are over twice the average wholesale price in 2017, and between one-to-two times the commercial and industrial rates in 2017."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"In 2017, some 70% of Serbia's generation came from coal, while most of the remaining 30% came from a combination of large and small hydro facilities.  Serbia has struggled to meet the unbundling requirement under the EU's so-called third energy package. As of late 2017, the state-owned TSO, Elektromreža Srbija (EMS), gained its license to operate and transmit electricity on the transmission system. To satisfy concerns over independent operation -- since the government also runs the state utility, Elektroprivreda Srbije (EPS) – EPS and EMS are operated by different ministries. But generation, retail and distribution fall under the control of the state-owned utility EPS. Serbia's import and export balances are sensitive to the country's hydrology – for its hydro generation, the condition of its aging fossil fuel plants, and demand dynamics from one of its seven interconnected, country neighbors."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Serbia has a consumption target of 36.6% renewable energy in the electricity sector by 2020. As of 2017, it reached roughly 27% thanks to hydro commanding a 37% share of installed capacity (plus some small generation from demonstration wind and solar projects). But with 500MW of wind capacity due online by 2020, it is expected to close the gap. To meet the EU's accession requirements, specifically, adhering to the 'Large Combustion Plants Directive', at least eight coal power plants need to be shut down by 2024. The generation gap is to be replaced by two new coal power plants, a combined heat and power plant, and at least 500MW of wind capacity. Since 2010, peak power demand has been flat."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"There are no obvious barriers to entry for clean energy development in Serbia. Technology capacity caps, as part of the feed-in tariff design, are the biggest challenge facing developers. Since they can secure a preliminary approval (termed 'temporary privileged power producer' status) into the capacity budget it leaves few opportunities for new developers. However, opportunities may arise once the feed-in tariff closes at the end of 2018 and the government looks towards feed-in premiums and auctions. Offtaker risk is low thanks to a robust PPA design that was included in the PPA package as part of the secondary legislation following Serbia's 2014 Energy Act."}]}
