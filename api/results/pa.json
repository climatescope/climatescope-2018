The sum of solar and wind capacity jumped from zero in 2013 to 397MW in 2017. Panama’s power market has been unbundled, and generation is open to private operators. Panama is also part of the Central American Electrical Interconnected System and is connected to Costa Rica via 150 km of transmission lines."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The business environment for renewable energy is positive in Panama. Although hydro still represents a larger source, solar and wind energy began increasing in 2014. Regulations mandate a 5% premium on the price paid for electricity generated from renewable sources, which includes biomass, geothermal, small hydro (up to 3MW), solar and wind."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Formal barriers to development of renewables in Panama are low. Since 2004, Panama has had tax incentives for the construction, operation and maintenance of clean energy projects. The policy grants clean energy projects with an installed capacity less than or equal to 10MW the ability to enter direct power purchase agreements (PPA) with the distribution utility as long as power sold does not exceed 15% of the distribution company’s maximum demand."}]}
