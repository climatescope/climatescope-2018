energy policy","value":"Morocco is heavily dependent on electricity imports from Spain and fossil-fuel imports for its energy needs, and has ambitious targets to change that. It aims to have renewables account for 42% of its generating capacity by 2020, and 52% by 2030. At the time these targets were announced Morocco had only 280MW of wind capacity and 20MW of solar. An aggressive $9 billion tender program was announced to achieve the target of both 2GW of wind and solar capacity by 2020. Some 350MW of commissioned solar thermal projects will bring Morocco’s solar capacity up to 600MW by end-2018. Installed wind capacity is currently at 1,048MW with the first of five wind farms comprising the 850MW tender closing finance in 3Q 2018. Timely commissioning of this project and the remaining pipeline of tenders will see Morocco meet its 2020 target. The renewables sector has received strong state support as it is seen as key to securing energy independence and reducing expensive fuel imports. The winning consortium from the five shortlisted bids for the 600-800MW of hybrid solar thermal and PV Noor-Midelt projects is expected to be announced by the end of 2018."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Moroccan solar tenders to date have stipulated storage requirements, to displace expensive generation from fuel oil currently used to meet high evening peak demand. Concessional finance from the World Bank’s Clean Technology Fund (CTF) has been key to kickstarting the Moroccan solar thermal industry. CTF and CTF MDB (co-financing) have totaled $1.3 billion across the Noor I-III and Noor-Midelt projects. This financing has in turn attracted a further $3.3 billion from multilateral and regional development banks. Developer finance and assumed equity make up the remaining $874 million of the Noor solar thermal projects as of 2018. In contrast, Moroccan wind projects have been successful in attracting significant amounts of commercial finance. Lured by the country’s world-class wind resource, commercial finance has provided some $894 million of the disclosed $1.76 billion invested in the wind sector since 2011. Total financing in the Moroccan wind sector is expected to reach $3.7 billion by 2020."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Power prices in Morocco are subsidized – the state utility, the Office Nationale de l’Electricité et de l’Eau potable (ONEE) does not pass on the full cost of generation to consumers and operates at a loss. Government support of the energy sector is a strain on public finances but has been rationalized within a developmental context. Servicing the 5% growth rate in electricity demand and the acute evening peak remains a primary concern in securing new generating capacity, with much of this slack having been met with expensive diesel generators. The difficulty and expense in meeting evening peak demand has resulted in storage requirements being added to Moroccan solar tenders and electricity tariffs that are 40% higher during the evening for commercial and industrial clients. The high cost of meeting the evening peak justified a PPA for the Noor I solar thermal project of $189/kWh in 2013, which includes five hours of storage. However, Moroccan and global PPAs for solar thermal have fallen since then, and the presence of existing solar thermal expertise and supply chains in the country, combined with PV hybridization, are fueling expectations of a competitive PPA for the Noor-Midelt projects to be announced by the end of 2018. In 2016, the PPA for 850MW of wind projects awarded to the Enel-Siemens-Nareva consortium set a world record price of $30/MWh on average. PPAs for PV auctions to date are unknown; however, most projects have been commissioned in the context of rural electrification and deferment of grid upgrades."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Coal has the largest share of Morocco’s power mix, accounting for 32% of capacity and more than 55% of generation in 2017. The coal sector has added more than 1GW of capacity since 2011 with a further 1.3GW expected online once the Safi plant is completed. In the context of total capacity growth of 20%, renewables’ share has remained constant at around a third for the last five years. Wind and solar capacity has doubled to 14% since 2011, and additions of a further 2.7GW of renewables capacity in the coming years will push this to the target of 42% by 2020. Recent years have been poor for hydropower and total renewable generation has been flat at around 16%. This has hidden growth in solar and wind generation from only 3% in 2010 to 11% in 2017. The Moroccan state utility, ONEE, still maintains a monopoly for the transmission network and is involved in all sales of electricity. It also accounts for around a third of total generation and more than half of the distribution and retail sectors of the power market."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Morocco’s electricity demand has grown at an annual average rate of 5.1% since 2010, slightly outpacing average economic growth of 3.5%. Of particular importance to the energy sector, peak electrical demand has also risen at a similar rate to total demand. Morocco has had great success in the electrification of rural areas, with the ONEE connecting more than 99% of the rural population to the grid by 2014. The renewable energy agency, Masen, has been instrumental in reducing both barriers and risk in Moroccan renewables investment. It has borne currency risk, performed environmental studies and carried out land preparation, issued green bonds, acted as an offtaker, and blended concessional finance to consolidate loans with debt profiles suited to both developers and Masen. All of these functions have contributed to the success of the projects to date and have helped streamline renewables investment in the country."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Morocco’s political stability and business-friendly legal frameworks have combined with its excellent solar and wind resources to fuel consistent speculation on its renewables ambitions. The local content requirement of the 850MW wind tender awarded in 2016 was met whilst also setting a world record low tariff. Completed in 2017, the Siemens-Gamesa blade factory in Morocco is the only facility of its kind in Africa. Located in the free-export zone of the port-city of Tangier, it is envisioned that this factory will enable further cost reductions for local projects in Morocco, whilst opening up export markets in Africa. Currently the law that provides the framework for renewables projects, law 13-09, only permits the sale of electricity over the medium- and high-voltage networks. In 2015, the publication of act 58-15 opened up the possibility of access to the low-voltage networks, seen as key to the growth of the small-scale PV sector. However, as of 2018, this act is not yet implemented and therefore any sale of electricity back to the grid by small enterprises or private individuals is not yet possible. This obstacle is intended to be removed in the short to medium term. Estimates of total wind resource potential for Morocco are as high as 25GW."}]}
