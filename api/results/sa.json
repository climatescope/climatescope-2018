energy policy","value":"The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has ambitious plans to develop clean energy and implement its plan articulated as the National Renewable Energy Program (NREP). This strategic initiative falls under Vision 2030 and the National Transformation Program (NTP) and is aimed to substantially increase the share of renewable energy capacity to 9.5GW by 2023. The program sets out a systematic and targeted road map to rapidly diversify the domestic power supply, catalyze economic development and support long-term prosperity in line with the goals of Vision 2030, which include creating a new renewable industry and supporting the build-up of this promising sector. Saudi Arabia opened bids for its first utility-scale 400MW wind farm in July 2018 with project award planned for December 2018."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The growth rate of clean energy has been dismal to date, with significantly more talk than actual project development. Renewables represent less than 1% of installed capacity in the country. Structural obstacles such as subsidized energy prices and the concentration of power generation assets among just a few institutions stymie development. These institutions await direction from higher government authorities regarding development responsibilities. A chicken and egg situation also exists in that there are substantial localization mandates, but renewable technology vendors are reluctant to establish local manufacturing in case policy shifts and markets do not materialize."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"The country's energy prices have long been subsidized well below regional and international levels. Energy prices, however, are on the rise – the most recent increase for electricity and petrol was at the beginning of 2018. The target is for energy prices to reach international levels by 2020.  As in the first round of NREP auctions, the winning bid for a 300MW solar tender that was won by local player Acwa Power came in at $2.36/MWh. Acwa was selected over an EDF bid of $1.78/MWh. Official Saudi policy is to eliminate many subsidies, but actually doing so may be harder than anticipated."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Oil accounts for the largest slice of generation capacity and this is a characteristic of the power generation sector that Saudi Arabia is intent on changing. It will do so by developing additional non-associated and unconventional gas fields and by adding more natural gas-fired capacity. Another big thrust for Saudi Arabia is solar and wind technology, development of which is just starting now. The power market is currently regulated and centralized, however, plans exist to privatize key institutions in the sector by 2020. Currently the Saudi Electric Co., through its wholly owned subsidiary National Grid, has a monopoly on electricity power transmission, operation, control, maintenance and rent of transmission network lines."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Electricity demand has grown at a very rapid clip in Saudi Arabia over the past few decades. Capacity totaled just over 87GW in 2016 and has risen 7.6-9% annually since 2000. This skyrocketing demand, driven by an expanding economy, a growing population and the need for greater volumes of desalinated water, has driven the country’s interest in power generation diversity and transitioning away from using oil in power generation. All of this has prompted efforts to promote the construction of new solar-powered plants and nuclear generation. Saudi Aramco has apparently spent the last three years mapping out solar and wind energy resources, which are reportedly robust."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Several Saudi institutions question whether Saudi Arabia's projected electricity demand growth will materialize. Energy efficiency improvements, possible slowing population growth and recent price increases for petrol and electricity may ease electricity demand growth, and it is unclear what may then happen to demand for renewables. There are ambitious plans to develop solar, including a proposed $200 billion, 200GW venture with Softbank. Still, local content rules of up to 30% may hinder these plans. There appears to be a concerted effort to support renewable energy development in Saudi Arabia, but the process of actually developing and building projects is a prolonged process."}]}
