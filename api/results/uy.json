energy policy","value":"Uruguay experienced a boom in renewable markets thanks to a series of technology-specific auctions combined with tax incentives. From 2013 onward, the country saw clean generation jump from 2% to an impressive 39% of the total. Wind and solar alone account for 28% of generation, by far the biggest penetration of intermittent technologies in emerging markets. The government of Uruguay established a 15% clean energy installed capacity target by 2015, which was met comfortably. From 2009 to 2013, Administración Nacional de Usinas y Trasmisiones Eléctricas (UTE) held several tenders. Since then, Uruguay added around 2GW of clean assets, summing to 4.5GW of total power capacity. Tenders held in Uruguay offered a premium payment for projects that use local content equivalent to more than 40% of the value of the total project."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Investments in Uruguay peaked in 2015, registering $1 billion in that year, mostly destined to wind assets. Driven by auction activities, investments in clean energy summed to $4.4 billion since 2011. More than 80% of that was invested in wind, followed by solar. Foreign investments are by far the biggest contributions. The biggest lead arrangers are Inter-American Development Bank and Inter-American Investment Corporation, proving debt to wind and PV projects. In 2017, investments reduced significantly, registering only $200 million, all in wind assets."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Uruguay is among the top 10 most attractive countries, in terms of tariffs, for renewable investors comparing other emerging nations. Stable and high prices make the country a good market for power project developers. In 2017, commercial, industrial and residential electricity prices averaged $246/MWh, $169/MWh and $245/MWh, respectively."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Uruguay’s electricity market is overseen by the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Mines and controlled by UTE. UTE allows the participation of independent power producers through project- or technology-specific tenders, usually based on 20-year power purchase agreements. Uruguay relies primarily on hydro resources to meet its power needs. Throughout renewables auctions, the country managed to diversify its power mix and reduce dependency on hydro. In 2017, 52% of the 14.3TWh generated in the country came from large hydro plants, while 26% came from wind, 18% from biomass and less than 2% from PV plants. Thermal plants had only a 2% contribution, compared to 35% in 2012."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Renewable markets in Uruguay have slowed down significantly since 2015, mostly because consumption has stabilized. Peak demand varies between 1,800 to 1,900 MW since 2013, while total capacity installed is at 4,500 MW."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The main barrier for Uruguayan clean development is the lack of demand growth. The country has deployed a significant amount of capacity relatively to its small market, and now, there is little room for more additions. Despite no sign of new tenders in the near future, the country still holds renewable energy incentives, which includes a value added tax exemption for wind generation and income tax reduction for clean energy and energy efficiency projects. Retail consumers may apply to UTE’s net metering program and receive credits for clean energy generation delivered to the grid."}]}
