energy policy","value":"Cote d'Ivoire is aiming for 42% renewables generation by 2030 (including hydro), up from 20% in 2017. Although the target is ambitious, the country has not yet introduced any significant clean energy policies and is still far from its 2020 interim target, with only some thermal and hydro capacity installed. The government initiated some tenders in 2016 for two biomass and one solar project of 20-25MW each, and could support the creation of further rounds, if the first one is a success. Solar players also benefit from modest tax exemptions. Yet their activity is limited to self-consumption projects, such as the distribution of individual solar kits, as the current framework does not allow for more."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"There has been no recent investment in clean energy, except in the 275MW Soubre dam, financed 15% by the Ivorian state and 85% through a commercial loan with Chinaâ€™s Exim Bank. Several other state-led hydro projects have been announced and are expected to follow similar financial structures, with a planned 10-15% participation from the state. Although a couple of independent power producers have announced biomass and solar projects, none has secured financing yet."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Power prices in Cote d'Ivoire are among the lowest of the region thanks to the use of gas and hydro resources. Production costs have not followed any specific trend and depend mostly on the fuel cost, as well as the share of thermal generation in the total mix. Despite those low costs, the sector has been running on a deficit and there is regular pressure from international organizations to increase retail prices. In 2016, an attempt at increasing prices led to riots in several cities in the country, forcing the government to abandon the measure.  A year later, it announced that tariffs would be frozen up to 2018, although there is ongoing pressure from the World Bank. Despite this, offtaker risk remains low as the utility is a financially sound company, owned by Eranove, itself linked to the private equity firm Emerging Capital Partners."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Cote d'Ivoire's electricity market is fully unbundled by law, but in practice only generation is open to competition and the utility â€“one of the few non-state-owned in Africa- is the sole offtaker of electricity. Three IPPs â€“ Ciprel, Azito and Aggreko â€“ own 60% of the capacity through multiple gas units. The rest consists mainly of state-owned hydro plants. Several IPP-led renewable projects are in the works. Thermal capacity is also set to increase, with a 700MW coal project in planning. This suggests the share of renewables will not increase in the short term. In the medium term, there are a number of hydro and solar projects in the pipeline. If these were completed, the share of renewables capacity could reach 45%."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Cote d'Ivoire's peak electricity demand has steadily increased by an average of 7% each year since 2011. Although the urban electrification rate is high (92%), the rural electrification rate is still relatively low (38%) â€“ full electrification is expected by 2025. Demand is therefore expected to continue to grow in the coming years. The government has established electrification through the main grid as its priority solution for the development of the power sector, with little focus on isolated grids. Mini-grids are currently not allowed, and self-generation projects cannot sell electricity to their neighbors. The rules could change post 2020, when the concession contract of the utility expires, although what will happen then is unclear at present."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Cote dâ€™Ivoire has little experience in renewables other than hydro, and policies that incentivize their development are minimal. The generation market â€“ the only segment open to competition â€“ is dominated by a few major players. General standards and procedures are lacking and transactions with the state are done on a project-by-project basis. Due to the utility's monopoly in electricity retail, the off-grid market is limited to self-consumption solar projects. Importing renewable components remains difficult despite some tax exemptions on solar products. Not all solar equipment is covered by exemptions, limiting the attractiveness of larger projects, and it can be cumbersome to secure the discount rates at customs, notably because of laborious administrative processes."}]}
