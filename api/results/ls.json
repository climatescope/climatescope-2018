energy policy","value":"The Lesotho Energy Policy (2015-2025) provides a strategy for the energy sector but has not been enacted into law, creating uncertainty over the status and plans for the sector. A draft renewable energy framework policy has also been developed, which includes mechanisms for procuring both off- and on-grid renewables, but this has not yet been adopted – resulting in uncertainty for investors. There are no specific regulations for off-grid renewables deployment. The country has set electricity access targets of 40% of the population by 2020 (currently 30%), and renewable energy is one of the main tools proposed to achieve this."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy investment in the country to date has been limited but there is at least one IPP with approved financing and private sector support. The government put forward a well-structured investment plan to the World Bank’s Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program in November 2017. A $1.5-million preparation grant was subsequently approved for a utility-scale solar plant, through the African Development Bank, and for distributed renewable energy solutions, through World Bank. Uncertainty in energy policy and slow implementation of a renewable energy framework have hindered investment."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"The utility Lesotho Electricity Co. says it must import approximately 282GWh a year (2016/17) of electricity from South Africa (Eskom) and Mozambique (EDM). The imports are priced between 0.77 to 1.50 maloti/kWh ($0.05-0.10), substantially higher than the price of power from it’s only power station, Muela Hydro (0.13 maloti per kWh). In 2015, electricity imports accounted for two-thirds of the utility's supply cost. The country has significant untapped renewable energy resources and has plans to procure further large hydro. The maloti is pegged to the South African rand."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The country has a single government-owned utility that is wholly responsible for procurement of power, distribution and management of the transmission grid. Lesotho has only one power station, 72MW Muela Hydro, and electricity is imported from South Africa and Mozambique in order to meet demand. Lesotho has significant renewables sources that are mostly untapped; realizing even only a couple of projects would greatly reduce the country's reliance on imports from neighboring countries. Lesotho is unique in that it is very mountainous, it is difficult to reach remote villages with transmission and distribution infrastructure, and as a result has low electrification rates especially in rural areas."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Lesotho is land-locked by South Africa. It imports all of its petroleum, some wood fuel and about a third of its electricity needs. This problem of energy security and access and declining biomass stocks is exacerbated by mountainous terrain, which limits network expansion. The government is committed to sustainable development and clean energy projects, especially those that help to increase electrification in rural areas. Peak power demand in 2016 was 153MW, but this is expected to grow to 304MW by 2020 and 432MW by 2030"},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"There are a number of overlapping energy sector entities including Department of Energy, Lesotho Electricity Co., Lesotho Energy and Water Authority and Rural Electrification Unit. This set-up has resulted in confusion, an underdeveloped regulatory framework, a lack of equipment technical standards and ultimately slow implementation of projects. There is limited availability of suitable land for renewables development – the terrain is mountainous and access is difficult, and where land is accessible it is often already being used for agriculture or settlement. There is a lack of awareness across the board about renewable energy technology and its potential social and economic benefits."}]}
