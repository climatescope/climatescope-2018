energy policy","value":"Somalia's power sector is completely decentralized, as a result of years of conflict and regional isolation. Power is delivered by independent 'electricity service providers' that usually own their own diesel generator and transmission and distribution lines, and sell power directly to consumers. The country is also divided into regions with no central administration overseeing the energy sector, while the self-declared independent Somaliland has its own energy ministry. Consolidation is naturally occurring among the many small IPPs, but lack of regulation raises concerns. Many international organizations, including the World Bank and USAID, are active in Somalia and are working to help establish a regulatory framework to incentivize IPPs."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Somalia owes significant debt to a number of international financial institutions, which means that it is ineligible for international development aid and concessional financing from many other sources. As international efforts are ongoing to develop a plan toward debt relief, investment in Somalia comes through short- and medium-term grants. A number of international organizations are undertaking large-scale projects focused on the power sector and energy security. Somalia also receives significant remissions from its sizable diaspora living abroad, and IPPs are in some cases able to fund projects directly through this kind of investment."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Retail power prices in Somalia are among the highest in Africa. Electricity service providers still rely mostly on older, inefficient diesel generators that have high fuel costs. Transmission infrastructure is fragmented and unreliable, and losses are very high â€“ around 40% compared to the sub-Saharan Africa average of 11%. Power producers are often not connected to other generators, which also increases costs and inefficiencies. Finally, technical know-how is lacking and metering consumers to measure consumption does not happen in most cases. As a result, many electricity providers charge based on the number of appliances or light bulbs used, which gives consumers little incentive to use more energy-efficient products or curb consumption."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"As the electricity supply is very unreliable, Somalis rely on traditional biomass for basic energy needs. The electricity suppliers that do operate mostly run diesel generators, though PV systems are starting to penetrate the market, mainly in the more stable region of Somaliland. While the initial investment required for a diesel genset is still lower in some cases than a PV system, adding PV to an existing diesel system is proving popular among small IPPs. Many electricity service providers operating in Somaliland have specific plans to add renewables to their existing diesel infrastructure."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The absence of reliable electricity supply is in general a major concern for Somalia and a significant barrier to doing business. Even those consumers that do have a grid connection are not satisfied with the quality of the power they receive. If generation capacity and transmission and distribution infrastructure improve, power demand could grow significantly. As the grid in Somalia is already very decentralized, off-grid and mini-grid development offer potential for electrification even in the most remote areas. Somalia's rich solar resources make PV mini-grid systems an attractive option, and one of the longest coastlines in Africa also offers good resource potential for wind."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Somalia's electricity sector remains almost entirely unregulated, which offers IPPs opportunities to enter the market without needing to compete with a national monopoly. On the other hand, the lack of a national transmission or distribution infrastructure is a major barrier to development of grid-connected projects. The local workforce is also lacking in technical expertise and even construction equipment is in many cases difficult to secure. Although Somaliland is quite stable, the security situation in other areas is also a deterrent to investors and makes it even more difficult to achieve financing."}]}
