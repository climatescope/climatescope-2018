energy policy","value":"Chad has been slow off the blocks in setting up renewable energy incentives. Although no such legislation is currently in force, tax incentives and a law facilitating the sale of privately generated output are being debated by the national assembly. The government has not set a national target regarding renewable energy deployment. But developers have praised the current administration’s commitment to building out production from clean power sources, pointing to the recent reinforcement of the Agency for the Development of Renewable Energy (ADER), whose bolstered remit encompasses facilitating land allocation and the signature of contracts."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"A number of renewable energy projects have either been announced or are under way, starting from the low base of no substantial deployment to date. Investment is exclusively international and disbursed at concessional rates. August 2018 saw the announcement of the biggest such undertaking thus far in the 60MW Djermaya Solar project, backed by a 6.35 million-euro ($7.3 million) grant pledged by the EU. Chadian developer ZIZ and Schneider Electric are planning to construct a series of 1MW hybrid plants financed by the AFD. But funding is scarce – difficulties in securing financing were partly behind the repeated delays that afflicted Vergnet’s 1.1MW wind farm at Amdjarass, which finally came online for initial testing in late 2017."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Although retail tariffs are heavily subsidized, amounting to around half the average production cost of around 251 CFA/kWh ($0.43 based on the average 2017 exchange rate), consumers face higher bills than neighboring states such as Cameroon. Tariffs have remained stable, having last been tweaked in the 2012, when they were slightly reduced. Seeing the government is squarely committed to increasing the wider population’s access to cheap electricity, there is little chance of rates being increased in the short term."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Chad switched from importing fuel from Cameroon and Nigeria to supplying its own oil with the construction of a refinery 2010. Although the current generation fleet remains almost entirely fired by fossil fuels, solar projects amounting to 90MW are in the pipeline. Procurement, transmission and distribution are the state utility’s prerogatives, but independent producers can sell their output, with Société Nationale d’Electricité du Tchad (SNE) purchasing electricity from a 20MW thermal plant owned and operated by VPower. Given that the SNE is the sole procurer of all generation, corporate PPAs are off the cards. A law setting out more detailed regulations for IPPs, clarifying procedures and penalties, is currently being debated in the National Assembly."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Despite having one of the world’s lowest electrification rates, and an official commitment toward providing electricity to 15% of the rural population by 2023, no coordinated electrification plan has been launched. Microgrid projects are few and far between for want of regulations covering off-grid generation. Meanwhile, the absence of a program aimed at rehabilitating the country’s ailing thermal fleet underlines the government’s bet on renewables to meet future demand. Yet concerns remain regarding a lack of investment in transmission and distribution, with grid congestion a particular issue for projects in and around N’djamena, the capital. The situation is exacerbated by the opacity surrounding grid extension plans, none of which have been published by the utility."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Developers must account for haulage fees over the 2,000km separating Chad from Douala on the Cameroonian coast, where much of the country’s imports are unloaded. Equipment costs could, however, be worse: although the practice has yet to be codified into law, import and VAT have recently been waived for components used in renewables projects. Legislation is being drafted to streamline licensing regulations, but the issuing of permits remains a drawn-out process. Payment delays notwithstanding, the utility has consistently managed to meet its contractual obligations in purchasing power from VPower, the aforementioned IPP. Renewable energy deployment can be slowed in other ways – the frequent hiring and firing of ministers has held up the implementation of a national clean energy strategy."}]}
