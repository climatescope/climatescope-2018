energy policy","value":"Bolivia has adopted clean energy policies and renewables represent a significant portion of the country’s 2.6GW generation base. The country’s National Development Plan 2017-2020, which commits to a total effective installed capacity of 4.9GW by 2020, targets a significant expansion in hydro capacity (1.4GW) and wind, biomass, geothermal, and solar (411MW), as well as combined cycle and gas plants (1.1GW). Bolivia also has a goal of increasing the share of 'alternative' energy (wind, biomass, geothermal and solar) and other sources of energy (combined cycle) to 9% in 2030, up from 7% in 2017. In 2014, the country published Decree 2048 to encourage clean energy development."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Development of clean energy projects in Bolivia is dominated by state-owned Empresa Nacional de Electricidad (ENDE), with investment coming from international development banks and the Central Bank of Bolivia. Non-hydro activity remains modest. The country’s first solar plant was commissioned in 2015, a 5MW project located in Pando department, which was followed by two more plants totaling 65MW brought online in Tarija and Potosi in 2018, all developed by ENDE. Bolivia’s first wind farm, Qollpana phase I (3MW) was commissioned in 2014 with a second phase (24MW) brought online in 2016. Wind projects lead the near-term pipeline, with four projects totaling 132MW having secured financing over 2017-18, also developed by ENDE and mostly located in Santa Cruz. A 50MW PV plant with financing from European development agencies is expected online in Oruro in 2019."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Consumer electricity prices in Bolivia are heavily subsidized. As a natural gas producer, Bolivia is reliant on this fuel for power generation, a trend which has steadily increased since 2010. In 2017, 72% of the 9.7TWh generated came from gas plants, followed by hydro, accounting for 23% of the total that year. Electricity prices have risen gradually since 2010, although rates remain low compared to most countries in Latin America, particularly residential and retail rates. In 2017, the average retail electricity price was $0.11/kWh, virtually unchanged since 2013."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Bolivia’s subsidization of natural gas prices limits free competition among players in the electricity market. Nevertheless, renewables represent a significant portion of the generation base. Eighteen percent of its installed capacity comes from biomass, small hydro, solar, and wind. Bolivia is seeking to expand its total installed capacity with a strategic objective of exporting electricity to neighboring countries, a plan that entails construction of new, primarily hydro, facilities, making the grid predominantly hydro (74% by 2025, up from 23% in 2017), a dramatic change from the current composition of the matrix. ENDE, through its 11 subsidiaries, is responsible for most generation, transmission, and distribution in the system."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Business opportunities for renewable energy in Bolivia may be improving, underpinned by an outlook of sharply rising electricity demand growth, which has averaged over 5% since 2010. The country’s plans for aggressive expansion of hydroelectric and other renewables sources with the overall goal of increasing energy exports could create new opportunities for investment. Early steps in introducing wind and solar onto the grid in recent years may pave the way for a greater role for these sources in official planning and targets. At 93%, Bolivia has a low electrification rate by regional standards and the government has a target of universal access by 2025, to be achieved via the its “Electricidad para Vivir con Dignidad” (Electricity for Life with Dignity) program, which focuses on extending the grid and installing PV, wind, and hybrid systems in low-income municipalities."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"A lack of clear incentives for renewable energy constrain opportunities in the electricity market in Bolivia. Nationalization of the energy sector beginning in 2010, which reversed privatization undertaken more than a decade earlier, has concentrated generation, transmission, and distribution within state entities, effectively eliminating competition. The country’s heavy reliance on natural gas-fired generation and subsidized power prices also limits competition and suppresses market signals for investment."}]}
