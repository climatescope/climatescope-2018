energy policy","value":"Historically, Botswana has lacked the legal framework and incentives to develop its renewable energy industry – the National Energy Policy has remained in draft form since October 2009. The two open tenders for a 100MW solar plant and 20 small hybrid off-grid plants are quite ambitious, especially considering they would represent almost 10% of the total installed capacity of the country in a single project. These tenders are also a first for the sub-Saharan nation in terms of scale. The only operational renewable project is 1.3MW. Previous experiences raise questions about the reliability of the process:   a tender in 2015 failed to move forward after attracting some 118 bids. The import and tax incentives have played little role in the development of the sector as they apply to a wide range of manufacturing goods and don’t make any special provision for the renewables industry, besides, awareness of these exemptions is low."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"There is only one commissioned grid-scale renewable energy project in Botswana to date, the 1.3MW solar PV project near Phakalane. It was financed through a $12.5 million grant from the Japanese Government. This is the only utility-scale renewable project to get financed in the last five years. Therefore the current foreign investment share stands at 100%. However, according to the World Bank, many entities are not able to prepare project proposals that meet the criteria for international finance. For the 100MW   solar tender, developers suspect that local commercial banks won't be able to compete with international concessional organizations as their terms would be unfavourable to the local developers that are looking for long tenors. International commercial banks have yet to have the chance to participate as no utility-scale projects have been permitted."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"For decades, electricity in Botswana has been heavily subsidized, however, this is slowly changing as tariffs have increased in recent years.  The private consumer only pays 0.28t pula  /kWh (10.32 Pula = 1 USD), while Botswana Power Corp’s (BPC)   production costs are 0.50 pula/kWh, dispatching power at a loss. In an effort to create more cost reflective tariffs, BPC has gradually increased the tariffs and steadily reduced the subsidy from 2.4 billion pula to 1.4 billion pula with the intention to reduce it further to 800 million pula in 2018. Electricity tariffs have risen consistently over the last decade at an average of 10% annually. Up until three years ago   residential consumers paid the highest electricity tariffs. BPC now charges their biggest customers, industrial users, the highest tariffs. This may need to be reviewed after the largest state mine in the country, BCL Mine Ltd., was forced into liquidation and closed in 2016."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The power sector in Botswana is dominated by coal, which accounts for 79% of the current installed capacity. By contrast, renewables, which is essentially solar, represents just 0.1%. This is due to change with the development of 100MW solar project that is currently in the proposal stage. Botswana has gradually weaned off from the Southern Africa Power Pool (SAPP) importing only 23% of the distributed power nationally. There is only one operational 1.3MW solar plant in the country and renewables do not benefit from purchase obligation as BPC buys all the power available regardless of sector. Currently, Botswana Power Corp. (BPC) is the sole provider of generation, transmission, distribution and retail services. However, BPC is looking to transform itself into a transmission and distribution utility, and move away from being a fully integrated utility. Independent power producers (IPP) have been allowed to enter the market since 2007 but have only began to expand into the generation market in the last two years. Two PPAs for the Morupule B Coal plant and a 1MW solar plant were signed in 2017."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Botswana boasts an impressive electrification rate of 59.05%. Botswana's power demand has plateaued in recently years, sitting at 610MW for the last three years. Demand has peaked as the mining sector has experienced a slowdown due to the commodities price slump – the largest state mine in the country filed for liquidation in 2016 and halted all operations. BPC has an aging power plant fleet. The oldest plant, commissioned in the late 1980s, is currently being refurbished and is expected to be operational in 2018."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Botswana, much like other Sub-Saharan countries, has an import duty exemption on all equipment and machinery, a category that includes solar panels, inverters and other parts. The country’s so-called manufacturing investment incentive is a broad policy that was brought in to bolster the manufacturing sector. The incentives makes no special provision for the renewables industry, however, they present an opportunity to develop a manufacturing industry, if the local market becomes more stable. There is offtaker risk as BPC has historically run at considerable loss and only made a profit once in the last 10 financial years.  In recent years, under the guidance of the newly appointed CEO, Stefan Schwarzfischer, BPC has managed to reduce its losses. Unlike its neighbors, Botswana has little currency risk – the pula has strengthened to the dollar by 33% over the last seven years."}]}
