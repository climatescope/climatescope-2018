energy policy","value":"Technology-specific auctions have been essential for renewables deployment in Peru. In 2008, under decree No. 1002, the government established auctions to contract on-grid renewable capacity every two years. Since then, four auctions have been carried out, resulting in 71 project developments, totaling 1.34 GW of biomass, small hydro, solar and wind capacities. To promote renewables, Peru also offers priority dispatch to clean energy plants and 20% accelerated depreciation for renewables projects. Peru also held an auction for off-grid solar in November 2014 to contract up to 500,000 off-grid PV systems. Ergon, the only one winner, announced that will develop 150,000-200,000 systems. Peru was one of the first countries in the world to hold off-grid energy auctions."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Peru attracted $2.3 billion in clean energy investment from 2011 to 2017. Most of the investments were into small hydro and onshore wind projects, equivalent to 39% and 32% of the total. Peru saw a peak in investment throughout 2012-2014, mostly led by financing of auction projects. In recent years, funds injected in the country have faded away, as only $300 million was invested in 2017. The country has received capital from international and national commercial financial institutions, as well as development banks. The biggest lead arrangers are U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and European Investment Bank, registering $235 and $213 million on PV and onshore wind."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Since 2012, average commercial and industrial power prices have risen 35%, while residential registered a 25% increment. By the end of 2017, industrial, commercial and residential prices were at $84.1/MWh, $112.1/MWh and $144/MWh, respectively. Even after recent increases, Peru’s electricity prices rank among the cheapest in Latin America. The latest renewable energy auction winners were announced in February 2016. The contracts awarded for wind and solar projects represented the lowest prices recorded on an unsubsidized basis in the Western Hemisphere at the time, at an average of $38/MWh and $48/MWh, respectively."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"In 2017, Peru generated 8% of its total 49TWh from renewable sources. Large hydro accounted for 52% in 2017, up from 40% in 2016, despite no significant capacity additions in this technology. Natural gas registered 37% in 2017, down from 46%. Coal, oil and diesel altogether generated the complementary stake. Comparing with total installed capacity in 2010, the year the first renewable auction was held, Peru remains at the same share for clean installed capacity, 7%. Despite observing a considerable increase of 243MW in onshore wind capacities comparing with 2010, the country decommissioned 282 MW of small hydro assets in 2017. The technology that had the most additions since 2010 was large hydro, totaling 1.5 GW. Peru established a 5% renewable target of its total electricity consumption to be met by 2013. The country reached the level established, but it did not define a new one."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Ministerio de Energía y Minas (MINEM) is the responsible for evaluating the need for auctions, and Organismo Supervisor de la Inversión en Energía y Minería (OSINERGMIN), the power sector regulator, conducts the tenders. A fifth renewable auction, expected to be held in 2018, was canceled in April 2017 and no new tender has been announced since then. MINEM’s explanation for the cancellation is that not all projects selected in the previous auction are being developed. In 10 years, Peru saw its electrification rate spike from 74% to 96%, the biggest increase in Latin American countries. The progress is due to a governmental rural electrification program, which included an off-grid auction aiming to contract PV systems for isolated regions in the country."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Peru’s energy consumption has been stable for the last three years, with an average of 1% increase in demand over the past two years. There are indications the country is oversupplied with power assets, which would be the main explanation for the hiatus in renewable auctions for the past three years. In terms of incentives, Peru does not charge import taxes for common renewable equipment such as wind turbines and PV panels, and charges an average of 18% of value added taxation."}]}
