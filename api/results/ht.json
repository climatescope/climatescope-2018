energy policy","value":"Improving access to energy has a central place in President Jovenel Moise’s program following his election in February 2017. The country aims to increase renewables’ share of power generation from zero in 2017 to 47% by 2030. The target is broken down as follows: 24.5% of generation is to come from hydro, 9.4% from wind, 7.5% from solar and 5.6% from biomass. A few months into office, the government abolished import duties on wind and solar generation products, as well as solar appliances. The 2017-18 Finance Act has abolished all import duties levied on PV generation equipment, wind generation equipment, and solar powered off-grid home appliances such as fridges, lights, chargers."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Haiti has not seen any investment for clean energy in recent years. This is similar to the trend seen with fossil fuels, with the total installed capacity only increasing marginally over the last five years. The only investors available for financing are international development banks – domestic financial institutions do not invest in renewable energy projects. Electricité d’Haïti (EDH), the national electricity company, has received grants from the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and other international organizations to help the company improve its infrastructure."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Considerable ambiguity exists regarding EDH’s tariffs, as no regulated authority exists to provide information regarding how prices are set. But bills charged to users have remained largely unchanged in recent years. Broadly speaking, industrial tariffs are set at $204.82/MWh, commercial at $201.01/MWh and residential at $115.74/MWh. It has been reported that actual prices charged to customers have been lower, potentially due to the recent depreciation of the Haitian gourde. No tariffs have been fixed for procuring the offtake of private generators – IPPs are free to negotiate with the state utility."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Haiti has around 284MW of installed generating capacity, with 80% comprising fossil fuel plants. The remaining 20% comes from the Péligre hydro plant, which is undergoing restoration, and a number of other small hydro plants. EDH owns 44% of Haiti’s generation capacity and is responsible for transmission along the 1,500km of power lines that run across the island. Due to infrastructure limitations, EDH’s provision of power to Haiti’s capital Port-au-Prince and several nearby cities is intermittent. Meanwhile, the use of diesel generators, kerosene lamps and other forms of off-grid technologies is widespread. Despite EDH’s monopoly on generation, thermal power PPAs have been awarded for 15 years. IPPs are responsible for generating most of the power sold by EDH."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The deficit between available capacity and demand has created opportunities for distributed clean energy. Financed by a USAID grant, Haiti’s first micro-grid started operation in the south of the country in 2015, providing solar power to around 450 households in the city of Les Anglais. The system relies on batteries and smart meters for system stability and to facilitate pre-pay capability for customers. Yet Haiti is prone to natural disasters, rendering generation assets vulnerable. The aforementioned micro-grid was partially destroyed after hurricane Matthew in late 2016. 20% of PV panels and all the cabling and polls were destroyed. EarthSpark plans to develop 80 other micro-grid projects."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"EDH’s continued mismanagement has long plagued the development of Haiti’s power sector. The state utility is on its last legs financially, with shortfalls such that it relies on government subsidies to maintain its operations. Losses are estimated at $200 million per year, 4% of the national budget. Connection costs charged by the electricity company are prohibitively high at $65. Moreover, EDH has proven itself unable to manage the generation it currently sources for its grid operations, with its dispatching system crude and inefficient."}]}
