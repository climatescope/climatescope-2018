energy policy","value":"The government has rolled out little in the way of incentives for the deployment of renewables. Nonetheless, Mauritania has comfortably overshot its goal of 20% of renewables capacity by 2020, set at the turn of the millennium. A public procurement system is in place, with the national utility, Somelec, issuing bids for renewable energy-related projects since 2013. Issues around the irregularity of the tender announcements persist, as well as the lack of a concession system to help developers take on geographically proximate projects. In a bid to spur greater private participation in generation, a law on public-private partnerships was issued in July 2017, but skeptics point to the absence of an implementing decree specifying a regulatory framework to enforce the law."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The government has overseen a steady increase in clean energy capacity since 2013, relying heavily on concessional funding, often from Persian Gulf donors. Highlights include the completion of several large PV projects, such as a 50MW plant commissioned in November 2017 – the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development footed the lion’s share of the project’s $53 million costs. Two wind farms have been commissioned, the biggest weighing in at 15MW. Moreover, investing in structural reforms alongside renewables projects, the UN Development Program, the French development agency and the EU have spent considerable sums on rural electrification. While still at the planning stage, the Zouérate 21MW PV plant looks to involve financing from several domestic banks, a first for Mauritania."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Electricity is currently imported from Mali within the framework established by the Senegal River Basin Development Authority (OMVS) at a rate of around $50/MWh. Generous subsidies have kept retail tariffs stable and low compared with other countries in the region. But while the overwhelming majority of citizens pay discounted ‘social’ rates bankrolled by the state, rural consumers are faced with steeper bills levied by microgrid operators. This disparity has long been contentious; the UNDP is carrying out a series of studies designed to amend the tariff system."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Solar is the country’s main clean energy source with 81.6MW installed to date. This is followed by wind with 30MW against nearly 300MW of thermal capacity. Procurement, transmission and distribution remain Somelec’s prerogatives. The country’s first PPA, linked to the construction of the aforementioned Zouerate solar plant, was signed with Clemessy. A second such agreement has been signed with an IPP for the installation of a 100MW wind farm. A number of 1-3MW solar-diesel hybrid projects have been brought online, most recently at Kiffa, a plant whose PV component amounts to 1.3MW. Expanding renewables capacity and the discovery of offshore gas have made the government eager to begin selling energy to its neighbors."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Officials predict that coming years could see a tripling of demand with the completion of three large transmission projects linking up large urban centers. Investment in renewables is set to continue despite imported hydropower and the allure of offshore gas. Meanwhile, access to electricity in rural areas will be bolstered when the third branch of the national electrification program, RIMFIL, is brought to bear. Often coupled with thermal generation, off-grid solar will remain crucial to powering Mauritania’s remote hinterlands. Although such hybrid plants as Kiffa are being built with future grid expansion in mind, distributed renewables will continue to play an important role in bringing electricity to rural communities."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"International agencies have observed that licensing and approval procedures are encumbered by rigid bureaucracy. Regulations can prove difficult to navigate, a situation compounded by a puzzling overlap between the remits of the various relevant public bodies. Similarly, international donors have highlighted a lack of transparency regarding forthcoming legislation, increasing uncertainty about reforms. Other issues include the lack of an effective electrification agency, slowing the implementation of a coherent regulatory framework that would encompass private and off-grid generation. Lastly, while import duties are waived for solar panels, upfront costs are driven up by their application to inverters and batteries."}]}
