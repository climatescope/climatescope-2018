energy policy","value":"Colombia’s historically weak policy support for non-hydroelectric sources of renewable energy, a product of its abundant large hydro resources, has resulted in limited wind and solar development to date. New momentum behind established policies may stand to change this. Colombia will hold its first long-term power auction in 2019. In June 2010, the country set a modest target of 6.5% of generation from non-large hydro renewables for end users with access to the grid by 2020. For those lacking access, the goal was set at 30%. Colombia's total generation from non-large hydro renewables that year was 4%. In 2011, it reached 6.2% before dropping in subsequent years. The 6.5% target was met in 2017 with 8% generated from non-large hydro renewables."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Colombia’s first long term power auction, scheduled to take place January 2, 2019, is expected to drive increased investment in renewables. The auction, which will be technology neutral, will offer a local currency, 10-year year power purchase agreement (PPA). Colombia’s Ministry of Mines and Energy has announced plans to contract 3,443GWh per year to be supplied from December 2022 onwards, which the government estimates would translate into approximately 1GW of capacity. Most investment directed to non-hydro renewable energy in Colombia to date has come from international development banks, including the IFC's loan to Celsia's solar PV portfolio, which includes Colombia's lone commissioned solar plant as of October 2018. However, growth in renewables will likely change this in the near term. Enel's 86 MW El Paso PV Plant, currently under construction, is likely financed from that company's balance sheet, though no information has been disclosed about the financing structure."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Colombia’s electricity prices have risen steadily since 2010, standing on average over 60% higher across commercial, industrial and residential segments. Colombia is highly dependent on hydroelectric sources, with 70% of generation supplied from this source on average annually since 2010. Prices are vulnerable to upward pressure from extreme weather, as seen in 2015-16 when a pronounced El Nino effect was observed. Higher temperature and a lack of rain diminished Colombia’s main water sources causing problems at key dams, isolated power outages, and increased reliance on more expensive natural gas, oil and diesel generation to meet demand. An accompanying a spike in wholesale rates resulted, which came down in 2017. Given Colombia’s reliance on large hydro and modest progress in development of alternative renewable sources, wholesale price volatility and reliance on imported natural gas (via LNG) is expected."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Of Colombia’s total installed capacity of 16.8GW at year-end 2017, large hydro represented 65% and provided 79% of the 67TWh generated that year, followed by natural gas at 9%. Other renewables accounted for 6% of generation, with most coming from small hydro. Capacity additions since 2010 have been dominated by hydro, as well as oil and diesel. Among renewables, Colombia had only 882MW of small hydro as well as a single 18MW wind plant and a single 10MW solar plant commissioned in 2017. Colombia’s power market has numerous private and state-owned players across segments, but is defined by substantial concentration. Empresas Publicas Medelin (EPM), Emgesa, and Isagen together accounted for 68% of generation in 2017. The fate of the landmark, 2.4GW Ituango hydro project is a key uncertainty in the country’s outlook. Previously expected to begin operations in late 2018, but now postponed indefinitely following a series of landslides and flooding at the site, whether Ituango can be recovered has major implications for Colombia’s firm supply outlook, its pace of non-renewables adoption, and power prices in the near and medium terms."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The business environment for renewable energy in Colombia is mixed. While the country has seen average electricity demand growth of 2.5% annually since 2010 and has a well-established regulatory framework governing its electricity sector, policies introduced to date have done little to accelerate development of non-hydro renewables. The government introduced tax incentives for investments in renewables in Law 1715, effective in 2014, which provides for accelerated depreciation of up to 20% per year for renewable energy investments, income tax deduction of 50% of investment value for up to 50% of taxable income for up to 5 years, VAT exemption for renewable energy equipment and services, and import duty exemption for renewable energy equipment not produced locally. However, as it took almost two years from enactment for the law to come into force, benefits to the market have been limited. The off-grid space, or zonas no interconectadas (ZNI), is characterized by a large amount of players, but faces implementation challenges in rural areas."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Investors are uncertain of the overall potential of Colombia’s clean energy market, given ambiguity around long-term planning scenarios, the slow pace and limited effect of policies adopted to date, and modest official targets. Colombia has no state-owned utility with which to sign long term PPAs; non-regulated industrial consumers are allowed to participate in the competitive market and to sign negotiated, long-term PPAs at unregulated prices. These PPAs can be entered into between the generator and non-regulated user directly. Colombia has an electrification rate of 99 percent, but areas that lack access overlap with former conflict zones.  Provision of basic services, such as access to electricity, was agreed to as part of the peace accords. Reaching the Ministry of Mines and Energy’s goal of 100 percent electrification is therefore tied to the broader process of reconciliation and will involve navigating relations with local communities."}]}
