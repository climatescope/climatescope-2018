energy policy","value":"The country aims to add 800MW of renewable energy capacity (500MW of biomass, 100MW of solar, 100MW of wind and 100MW of mini-hydro) by 2025, under the government’s energy strategy \"Visão Angola Energia”. Most of Angola’s electricity demand is met by large hydro. In 2017, the technology accounted for 54% of its 4.7GW of installed capacity and three-quarters of the 10.5TWh generated that year.  The $23-billion energy strategy for 2018-25 aims to reach 9.9GW of total capacity, and boost electricity access rates from around 35% in 2017 (rural areas: 16%) to 60%. By this time, natural gas is to meet a fifth of generation, hydro 64% and 8% from other renewables. Of the 9.9GW of new build, just under a third will be developed through public-private partnerships. Angola has no substantial incentives such as feed-in tariffs or auctions to promote renewable energy deployment."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"With an energy sector dominated by large hydro plants, Angola has not received significant investment in utility-scale clean energy plants in recent years. However, its 2025 energy strategy will require substantial investment in renewables, much of which is likely to come in the form of concessional financing."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Angola’s residential and commercial electricity prices have not changed since 2013 at $33.5/MWh and are among the lowest prices across emerging markets. As such, there is little incentive for consumers to install small-scale PV. The country does not have an industrial tariff or a wholesale power market."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Much of Angola's infrastructure was destroyed during the 27-year war, which ended in 2002, and had to be built and refurbished. A significant investment program increased generation capacity from 700MW in 2002 to around 4.7GW in 2017. The country saw capacity jump 80% in 2017 as a result of 1.4GW of two large hydro plants and a 750MW gas plant. Half of the new large hydro capacity came from the first phases of the flagship $4.3 billion Lauca, due to become the largest hydropower plant in Southern Africa, alongside Mozambique’s CahoraBassa. As part of an electricity sector reform beginning in 2014, the power market was unbundled into: Prodel on the generation side, together with RNT and ENDE as the transmission and distribution system operators. Gamek saw its mandate extended beyond just hydropower to oversee the development and construction of most major power projects. Once completed, these are then transferred to Prodel for operation. The power network is still fragmented across three regional grids (Norte, Centro and Sul) and some isolated systems."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Angola – like its fellow oil exporters – continues to face tough economic conditions, following the drop in commodity prices. But after GDP rose by an estimated 1.5% in 2017, Sub-Saharan Africa’s third-biggest economy is due to return to higher growth rates over the next few years. Angola’s electrification rate in 2017 was 35%. In spite of the country’s history of hydropower, for 2025, the country expects to invest in renewable energy, connecting over 800MW to the grid."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The 2015 Electricity Law established the legal framework for independent power producers (IPPs), and the government is working with the African Development Bank to implement the legislation including PPAs and feed-in tariffs. In the meantime, IPPs are still rare in Angola and PPAs are negotiated on a case-by-case basis. The sector has also been suffering from a number of inefficiencies: non-payment from customers is a challenge, with over 80% not metered. In addition, the cost of electricity production and distribution is high; the average consumer tariff is low; and technical and commercial losses are sizeable (around 50%)."}]}
