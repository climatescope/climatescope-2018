energy policy","value":"El Salvadorâ€™s government is strongly focused on diversifying its power matrix and reducing its oil dependency by adding renewable energy capacity. Since 2013 the country has held three auctions, contracting 285MW of renewable capacity. The country also offers income and import tax exemptions to clean energy projects and guarantees priority dispatch to electricity generated from renewable sources."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"El Salvador's clean energy sector attracted $926 million of investment over 2010-2017. Over half of the investment was directed to PV plants, which received $532 million, followed by $250 million for biomass and waste. Largely due to its successful clean energy auctions, over 65% of the total was recorded in 2016-17."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"From 2015 to 2016, electricity prices in El Salvador decreased on average by 20% (commercial, residential, industrial and wholesale). However, dry conditions in 2016 that reduced reservoir levels resulted in increased generation from bunker and other fossil fuels, causing electricity prices to rise in 2017. Commercial prices increased 11% from $199/MWh in 2016 to $220/MWh in 2017. Both residential and wholesale prices increased by 12% over the same period, while industrial prices rose by 6%."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"El Salvador had 1.9GW of installed capacity in 2017. Oil and diesel constitute the single largest source, with 41% of the total, followed by large hydro with 29%. Among renewables, biomass and geothermal dominate, with 14% and 11%, respectively, however PV capacity has increased four-fold since 2015, reaching 60MW in 2017. Both wind and solar are poised to grow over the next two years with 100MW of solar PV projects and 70MW of wind expected to come online. El Salvadorâ€™s power market has been unbundled and generation is open to private operators. The country is part of the Central American Electrical Interconnected System and is connected to Guatemala and Honduras by 286km of transmission lines."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The business environment for renewable energy is positive in El Salvador. Total generation and peak demand have increased significantly every year between 2012 and 2017, growing by 11% and 26% respectively, over the period. The National Energy Council (CNE) estimates annual demand growth of 2.2% per year through 2035. In the first half of 2018, the country commissioned 30MW of PV capacity as part of the Bosforo Project, a joint-venture between AES and Central American conglomerate CorporaciÃ³n Multi Inversiones (CMI) that is expected to commission a total of 100MW of solar capacity over the next two years."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Formal barriers to development of renewables in El Salvador are low. Under decree 462 of 2007, El Salvador grants tax incentives for development of renewable energy sources, including 10 years of import tax exemption to machines and equipment, and income tax breaks for renewable energy projects. The incentive is valid for the first 5 years of the operation of projects between 10 and 20 MW, and 10 years for projects of less than 10MW capacity. Furthermore, state-owned Empresa Transmisora de El Salvador (ETESAL) is required to guarantee priority dispatch to electricity generated from renewable sources."}]}
