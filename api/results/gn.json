energy policy","value":"Guinea offers no renewables incentives. This partly results from the country’s abundance of rivers and the government determination to tap into an estimated 6GW of hydropower potential. With no installed renewables capacity to date, Guinea’s target to increase clean generation capacity to 30% by 2030 appears far off. Promising developments include the creation of a rural electrification agency and an independent regulator in 2017, as well as forthcoming amendments to the 1993 Electricity Law, which are tailored to encourage private participation in generation. Reforms geared toward IPPs will have to wait until national utility EDG emerges from private management – the four-year contract signed with Veolia expires in mid-2019."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"What little renewables funding exists comes from foreign actors such as the French development agency (AFD) and EU, mostly in the way of grants targeting rural electrification or small hydro feasibility studies. By and large, foreign investment in the energy sector has been funneled into large hydro, although concerns regarding variations in flow rates have led a number of developers to countenance hybrid dams kitted out with solar panels. Attracting funds has been complicated by the government’s lack of financial headroom, ruling out sovereign guarantees for the foreseeable future. But the current administration is eager to lock down further concessional funding, with talks under way regarding launching projects through the International Finance Corp.’s Scaling Solar initiative."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Domestic power prices, which have been unchanged over the last decade, are among the region’s lowest. The government is eyeing future tariff increases as a necessary measure to buttress reforms, yet an outbreak of riots following a fuel price hike in February 2018 may stay the government’s hand in the short term. Alterations to current rates are to be based on an ongoing African Development Bank tariff study, which is likely to conclude that retail bills should be raised by 30% over three years in order to facilitate the state electricity company’s recapitalization. Insofar as power purchasing by the utility is concerned, EDG agreed to pay China Water and Electric around $85/MWh for energy produced by the 240MW Kaléta dam, which was completed in 2015."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"About two-thirds of generating capacity is derived from large-scale dams, with the completion of the aforementioned Kaléta project in 2015 effectively tripling the country’s installed large hydro potential. The build-up of hydro capacity is set to continue with a series of dams in the pipeline, including the 450MW Souapiti project tabled for 2020. The rest of Guinea’s electricity fleet is oil and diesel-fired. There are plans to develop offshore gas fields, but reserves remain unproven. Efforts to liberalize the power market are driven by the prospect of trading competitively within the West African Power Pool: the first of four planned interconnection lines should be exporting electricity by 2020 (three are under construction)."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Electrification will continue to push up demand, with 70% of the population remaining unconnected despite a 10% increase in national electricity access rates since 2010. That less than a tenth of the rural population is hooked up to the grid renders distributed energy options all the more attractive. Crisscrossed by an estimated 1,165 watercourses, the country has considerable small hydro potential – over 300 sites have been mapped, many of which could support microgrids. Backed by the EU and World Bank, the government is poised to develop the first such location on the Tinkisso river. Existing thermal plants have been modernized; a program funded by the European Investment Bank aims to do the same for the country’s large hydro assets."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Access to finance is consistently identified as the biggest issue holding back the implementation of renewable energy projects. Moreover, the absence of microgrid regulations or clean energy incentives also has much to do with the country’s reliance on large hydro, the abundance of which has long restrained the allure of renewable sources. A lack of experienced personnel throughout the project development supply chain further increases the upfront costs facing would-be developers. Prospective investors must also take import duties and VAT into account, which they could be saddled with despite the possibility of ad hoc exemptions."}]}
