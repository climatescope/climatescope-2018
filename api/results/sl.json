energy policy","value":"The Sierra Leone renewable energy targets are ambitious only in the implied increases in electrification, and not in the percentage of renewables added as the country’s power is already supplied by mostly biomass and hydroelectric generation. The targets call for 4,703ktoe/annum (79.7%) of renewable energy contribution to final energy consumption by 2020, rising to 8,950ktoe/annum (84%) in 2030. Ratified in 2017, the targets are yet to be supported by instruments to encourage renewable development. An Electricity Sector Reform Roadmap released by the government later that year in partnership with the Millennium Challenge Corp. proposed a comprehensive array of feed-in tariffs for small projects, auctions for large-scale assets, and net metering for behind-the-meter systems."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"As stability returns following decades of political and social turmoil, the lack of stable policy mechanisms has hindered Sierra Leone clean energy investment from also recovering. Most rural electrification projects are sponsored by concessional agencies with little private sector involvement. However, a pico solar industry is maturing and independent renewable power producers are starting to see commercial lenders willing to finance projects that sell to the state-owned utility through a PPA . These financiers typically have experience in other, more mature, West African markets such as Ghana."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Significant cross-subsidization between customer classes means a low-use domestic consumer can pay as little as 560 SLL/kWh (6.7¢/kWh), while an industrial facility or hotel incurs 1,412 SLL/kWh (17¢/kWh). The Electricity Distribution and Supply Authority has proposed significant increases to the most heavily subsidized rates and modest increases across other classes. For bulk supply, most of the utility’s procurement costs are unknown. A deal signed with the Turkish Karadeniz Powership in 2017 at 19.596¢/kWh was later renegotiated down to 16.4¢/kWh for 30MW of baseload supply over five years – a blended rate reflecting both capacity and fuel payments. A pressing need for substantial investment in the Sierra Leone grid may place upward pressure on rates in the future, while the development of solar and hydroelectric generators may further contain costs and subsidy levels."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Sierra Leone’s power system was partially unbundled in 2011. The National Electricity Act separated the Electricity Board into two state-owned entities: the self-descriptive Electricity Generation and Transmission Corp. (EGTC) and Electricity Distribution and Supply Authority (EDSA). The country’s power system is extremely dependent on hydro generation operated by EGTC and procured by EDSA through PPAs approved by regulators, such that the seasonality of water supplies leads to lingering supply constraints. The arrival of the Karpowership, a 126MW floating power plant, in Freetown Harbor in late 2017 has relieved some stress on system and power prices, but issues remain. EDSA also procures power through PPAs with renewable and non-renewable independent power producers."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Sierra Leone is increasingly attractive for renewables development. Newly minted president Julius Maada Bio has launched a crackdown on corruption within government and state-run organizations, while promising to push ahead with electricity sector reform. Import and sales tax exemptions have fostered the development of a pico solar industry, with micro-grid and small utility-scale projects set to follow. While the local supply chain is incomplete and policy instruments to support projects are currently lacking, there is growing interest in the West African market. Foreign players, including Lebanese, Chinese, and Ghanaian firms, are seeing Sierra Leone as an up and coming opportunity."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The lack of clear policy enablers and a uniform offtake arrangement is the most significant barrier to the Sierra Leone clean energy industry. While energy remains a key social issue, the government’s immediate priorities lie in addressing corruption within its own ranks and improving health and wellbeing following the Ebola crisis. The nation’s weak and limited grid presents challenges for independent power producers to bring capacity to markets, even when the project economics are viable. Additionally, Sierra Leone’s distinct wet and dry seasons present challenges in planning and operating a system dependent on hydroelectric generation."}]}
