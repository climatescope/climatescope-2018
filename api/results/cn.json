energy policy","value":"With 635GW of renewable energy capacity, China is home to the world’s largest renewable energy market. Top-down targets and generous feed-in tariffs have driven strong growth, so that both solar and wind capacity will surpass the government’s 2020 targets (110GW and 210GW, respectively). The result is a prolonged deficit in the government’s funding support, now estimated at 150 billion yuan ($22 billion). In response, China’s National Energy Administration (NEA) announced in May 2018 a major revamp of policies supporting wind and solar. Future new wind projects must compete in auctions and new solar subsidy quotas are on hold, possibly reduced in 2019. The policy changes came faster than the industry expected, particularly for solar. About 97GW of 151GW of commissioned solar plants have yet to qualify for subsidies. It is unclear if they ever will secure the quota. Regulators are planning to introduce renewable portfolio standards by the end of 2018. However, it remains unclear whether or not these non-subsidy measures will be enough to offset the subsidy deficit or help to maintain the momentum of China’s renewable energy investment."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"After a dip in 2016 due to the wind and solar installation freeze in several curtailment-prone northern provinces, clean energy investment increased by 23% in 2017, to $132 billion. Since 2013, solar has surpassed wind to attract most funds. The gap between them was most pronounced in 2017, when the 53GW of new solar capacity attracted $86.5 billion, while wind only received $36 billion. Investment so far has come predominantly from Chinese sources, with the China Development Bank at 24% of total asset finance. Multilateral banks such as the World Bank have supported early development, and can provide international concessional finance. A large number of domestic banks, such as Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, provide commercial financing."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"China has some of the cheapest residential electricity in the world because it is subsidized by commercial and industrial (C&I) rates. It began in 2016 to address this cross-subsidization by lowering retail C&I power costs. In March 2018, regulators announced a goal to reduce retail C&I tariffs by 10%. By June, 25 out of the 33 provincial or sub-provincial markets had cut rates by about 6%, mainly due to reductions in government surcharges and taxes. Levelized costs of PV power has dropped significantly on the back of efficiency improvements and oversupply – especially in 2018 after the change in the solar market. Now subsidy-free solar is getting traction. Wind LCOE has been steadily decreasing too."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Coal is still the dominant fuel in China’s power system, accounting for 62% of capacity and 71% of generation in 2017. Wind and solar are growing rapidly, however, accounting for 17% of capacity and 7% of generation on aggregate. Renewable energy curtailment has been a chronic challenge, but regulators have implemented various measures to combat this, like mandating minimum dispatch and allowing renewables to participate in deregulated power sales. As a result, national average curtailment fell to 3.6% for solar and 8.7% for wind in 1H 2018, from 6% and 12% respectively in 2017. Regulators are piloting various market mechanisms including bilateral corporate PPAs, power exchanges, and spot markets to further liberalize the retail market."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"In 1H 2018, China’s gross power demand grew by 9.4%, reaching 3,229TWh. This is the fastest growth since 2011, on the back of strong recovery in heavy industry demand and a record surge in power consumption by households and public institutions. Switching from fossil fuels to renewables, and electrification of transport, cooking, heating, industrial processes, etc. are long-term policy goals that will continue to present opportunities for investment. BNEF forecasts a slowing of China’s power demand growth in 2H 2018, with full-year rise of 8%. We expect a further slowdown in 2019 and 2020, due to downward pressure from the U.S.-China trade war on manufacturing, iron and steel, aluminum, etc. Even with the slowdown, national power demand in 2020 will reach 7,715TWh, 7% higher than the upper target set by China’s 13th Five-Year Plan."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"China’s strong local manufacturing capacity for wind and solar leaves little space for overseas players to compete. Even though the escalating trade war with the U.S. looms large on growth, its impact on China’s wind and solar developments, batteries and electric vehicles has been limited. The government is opening up more of the energy sector – such as the distribution grid and electric vehicles – for domestic private and foreign investment. But these and other policy changes have given rise to short-term uncertainties around the speed of government-allowed growth in wind and solar, and questions about where in the liberalized retail power market the incumbent grid companies will allow for competition."}]}
