energy policy","value":"Zimbabwe emphasizes clean energy as one of the pillars of its development plans. The National Renewable Energy Policy (drafted in 2017 but yet to be put in force) sets two goals: to achieve an installed renewable energy capacity of 1,100MW (excluding large hydro) or 16.5% of total electricity supply, whichever is higher, by 2025, and for renewables to reach 2,100MW, or 26.5% of total electricity supply, whichever is higher, by 2030. The Renewable Energy Feed-In Tariff policy and net metering regulations are also not fully implemented yet. The Rural Electrification Fund, in comparison, has been effective, and 427 microgrids have already been commissioned across the country; it is derived from a 6% surcharge on electricity consumption."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Growth in clean energy investment has been slow. The single IPP offtaker, ZETDC, and the general economic situation of the country have not instilled confidence in investors. Although some projects have been awarded licenses, few of them have been constructed or commissioned in the last five years. If the country moves toward an auction approach, as the Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority (ZERA) has indicated that it plans to from 2019, it will help create a transparent process and attract more interest from clean energy providers and IPPs. The immaturity of the market means there has been limited international financing available to projects. The controversial government-funded Gwanda Solar project has been riddled in corruption scandals from the start. Already three years behind schedule, the future of the project is unknown after recent parliamentary hearings."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Electricity prices in the country are set by ZERA and are higher than in other countries in the region. This is partly because the country imports expensive power from Mozambique and South Africa to meet demand. Despite the higher prices, the utility is still operating at a loss. The power fleet requires modernization and investment, with most power stations operating at low capacity factors. Renewable energy, in the form of solar and hydro, have potential to meet the supply deficit at competitive LCOEs."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The monopolized electricity sector is controlled by state-owned utility Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) and regulated by ZERA. Offtaker risk is high due to the utility’s struggling balance sheet. Due to insufficient supply, Zimbabwe heavily relies on imports from both Eskom (South Africa) and EDM (Mozambique) in order to meet the power demand in the country. Large hydro (Kariba Power Station) and coal (Hwange Power Station being the largest), owned by ZESA, make up the bulk of the country’s own generation with a small contribution from biomass and small hydro IPPs."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The country imports expensive power from Mozambique and South Africa in order to meet demand. Despite the supply deficit, Zimbabwe also has contractual obligation to export 150MW to Namibia. Both the generation (besides Kariba) and transmission infrastructure is outdated and requires significant investment in order to restore potential capacity. Zimbabwe has extensive coal resources but also great renewables potential, both hydro and solar. The country experiences frequent load shedding. Electrification rate in rural areas is 16% with the bulk of communities relying on wood fuel for cooking and kerosene for lighting."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The government is taking steps to improve the ease of doing business in the country and trying to open up it up to more foreign investment. With relatively outdated infrastructure, the country struggles with poor roads and, at times, disrupted electricity supply. Solar equipment (including solar lanterns) can be imported duty free but are still subject to 15% VAT. Countrywide, a lack of awareness and understanding of clean energy products may hinder short-term uptake."}]}
