energy policy","value":"Senegal has nearly reached its 2025 goal for 15% of renewable energy in electricity supply, given that it is currently at 13% with the commissioning of several solar projects at the end of 2017. The country will easily surpass its target, especially when the 158MW Lekela wind farm comes online. The next Lettre Politique du Secteur de l’Electricite will be published late in 2018 and may set a new renewable energy target. Senegal introduced a new investment code this year so that utility-scale renewable energy projects are exempt from paying VAT on power production and import duties on components. This will decrease cost and administration for projects in development. The Scaling Solar auction in April 2018 led to the lowest cost of solar power Senegal has seen, due to competition between established foreign companies to build projects in the African country. Senegal has yet to launch its own separate auction scheme, aside from the World Bank’s Scaling Solar program."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Energy project development in Senegal is becoming increasingly vibrant with new stakeholders seeking opportunity to invest. Four solar projects totaling 100 megawatts have come online in the last couple of years and in 2018, Senegal’s first utility-scale wind farm reached financial close.  Lekela is providing equity for the project and debt is being provided by U.S. and Danish development banks. Lekela is a joint venture between Dublin-based developer Mainstream Renewables, and Actis, a London-based private equity firm. Lekela’s financial close shows the improved maturity of the energy market, particularly after the successful completion of several solar projects in the last year. Projects in Senegal continue to rely upon development bank finance, but the presence of foreign investors Meridiam and Lekela in the country highlight the growing maturity of the sector."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Electricity prices in Senegal have stayed relatively stable in recent years, with higher prices for commercial and industrial users compared to residential. Tariffs are higher in rural areas than they are in areas governed by Senelec, so the government is currently undertaking a process of harmonization of tariffs to make the situation fairer. Prices for diesel and kerosene have fallen in line with oil price trends in recent years. Power prices in Senegal are significantly higher than in Cote d’Ivoire where tariffs are subsidized more. This reflects Senegal’s lack of natural resources in comparison to the Ivory Coast, and the smaller scale of its power sector."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Senegal still relies heavily on thermal power plants to provide the majority of its 800MW installed capacity, but the proportion generated by solar power is increasing rapidly, and the country’s first utility-scale wind project will provide around 15% of electricity demand when complete. Some 75MW of hydropower is imported into Senegal from nearby Mali, and there are also plans to import another 40MW from Mauritania once the relevant transmission line is complete. The power-market structure is partially liberalized in Senegal. Private companies can operate in power generation, but transmission and distribution is still controlled by state-owned utility Senelec until 2019. The exception to this is the rural concession areas where IPPs have been granted ownership across the power market structure."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Senegal has a national electrification rate of 68%, which has steadily increased over recent years in line with the target for 100% electrification by 2025. Access to electricity in rural areas is much lower, at just 40%, but the division of the country into concession areas to be electrified by private companies should speed up the process through the installation of mini-grids. The discovery of gas reserves off Senegal’s coast could also improve the outlook for domestic resource exploitation. Economic growth is projected to remain at 6.8% this year, according to the World Bank. Its stable government and adoption of the Plan Senegal Emergent in 2014 have helped to make it an economic hub in West Africa."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"There is no manufacturing capacity in Senegal for wind turbines or solar panels, so developers must import components when building projects. Utility-scale renewable energy projects are exempt from paying VAT on power production and import duties on substituent components under the latest investment code, but small-scale projects remain subject to VAT of 18% and import duties of 25%. Solar panels are the only exception, subject to a lower tariff of 5%. Obtaining these exemptions and tariff reductions can nevertheless be a lengthy and costly process for developers and companies providing small-scale power. For the last two years, power offtaker Senelec has been in profit, so offtaker risk is now lower. Bureaucratic hurdles are still present but are decreasing as more IPPS enter the market and the launch of Scaling Solar auctions makes it simpler for international companies to enter the space."}]}
