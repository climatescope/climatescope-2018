energy policy","value":"Sri Lanka has decided to move away from feed-in tariffs to auctions, except in select areas such as rooftop solar. It recently approved a long-term electricity generation plan (2018-37). This includes new coal plants, which is what the main utility, Ceylon Electricity Board, wanted, and it also envisages new gas and renewable energy plants, which is what the regulator Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka, or PUCSL, favored. This compromise ended the rather public difference of opinion between the CEB and the PUCSL. The next long-term plan for 2020-39 is to be submitted by April 2019. The debate on the future energy mix will continue, and the final energy choices are yet to emerge. Sri Lanka's grid is isolated, having no connections with any of its neighbors yet, and that fact also impacts future planning."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Unlike any other country in South Asia, Sri Lanka boasts 100% electrification. New power plants are required to meet growing demand, and also to balance retirements. The island nation of about 20 million people has a large base of small hydro plants, is expanding wind and solar, and piloting newer technologies such as geothermal and wave energy. Multilateral lenders like the Asian Development Bank and IFC are active in the market, lending funds and providing technical assistance. Some of the recent smaller-sized solar projects auctioned are aimed at giving the local entrepreneurs an opportunity in this sector."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Sri Lanka has among the highest tariffs in the world for residential users (45 rupees or 28 U.S. cents), that partly explain the rapid uptake of rooftop solar in households. The tariffs in the industrial and commercial segments are lower. Tariffs have not been revised since 2014. The CEB “has not done adequate work to improve transparency [of its transactions] that would compel the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka to revise tariffs,” according to Kanchana Siriwardena, PUCSL’s director of tariffs and economic affairs."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The power market in the country is a long way away from liberalization. The CEB is yet to be unbundled, and seems to be on a constant collision path with the regulator PUCSL. Besides their differences on the ideal long-term generation mix for the country, the regulator is unhappy with the delays in new plant construction by the utility. Resorting to oil-fired emergency power is not only expensive, but also extremely polluting."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Rooftop solar is a bright spark in renewable energy in Sri Lanka. The availability of a net metering scheme coupled with high tariffs means that more and more rooftops are aiming for solar installations. The latest government budget (unveiled in November 2017) also offers subsidized loans (at 8%) for the installation of solar panels by households and entrepreneurs. The import of equipment for renewable energy is exempt from the national building tax and as well as the ports and airport levy."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"With its limited area and population, Sri Lanka could be an ideal market for electric vehicles. The budget offered some tax exemptions for setting up EV charging stations, even as a plan for electrifying mobility is being worked on. Also in the pipeline are a host of pilot projects in what are being described as \"exotic technologies\": large-scale battery storage, ocean energy, small wind power vertical-type systems and hybrid power systems combining solar, wind and batteries. Though the aspirational target of 100% clean energy is often heard, the fact is that new coal plants are part of the new long-term energy plan, despite opposition from the regulator."}]}
