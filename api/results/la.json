energy policy","value":"The government of Laos has billed the country as the “battery of Asia”, eager to capitalize on its abundant hydroelectric resources and small population to export energy to its larger, fast-growing neighbors. Accordingly, it has focused its attention on building large hydro facilities that, in many cases, send power directly across its borders to Thailand or Vietnam. The government has announced a target for non-hydro renewables to provide 30% of the power mix by 2025, but few actors in the country take this target seriously. There are no other significant policies to promote renewables, although international groups such as USAID have been working with the government to help design a pilot renewable energy auction, which may take place in 2019 at the earliest."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Laos’s power market is currently oversupplied with carbon-free hydroelectricity, creating little incentive for the government or local companies to invest in non-hydro clean energy technologies. The bulk of recent investment – in large hydroelectric facilities and a single coal-fired plant – has been financed by Thailand and Vietnam for their own consumption. Only one large-scale solar project has been built to date in Laos, by a local company (EDL-GEN) but with significant support from international partners. China, Thailand, Japan and Vietnam are dominant players in the market. There is little to no domestic concessional financing available, and few Lao banks have the capacity to finance power projects."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Power prices in Laos are relatively low, due to its abundance of low-cost hydroelectricity. The government sets electricity tariffs and subsidizes industry, residential consumers, agriculture and small and medium enterprises with rates below the cost of service. Banks and hotels, on the other hand, see significantly higher tariffs, which can make onsite solar competitive for a small segment despite the absence of net metering or other incentives. Although rates have remained fairly steady over the past five years, rising roughly 2-3% annually, the government is planning to publish new, higher rates in 2019."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The domestic power market in Laos has a single-buyer structure, with Electricite du Laos (EDL) the sole buyer and retailer as well as the grid operator. Power generation was partially liberalized in 2010, when EDL spun off its large hydro assets under EDL-GEN, in which it owns a stake of about 75%. Independent power producers are also active in the market; they have been responsible for roughly 90% of the capacity additions since 2015. Capacity additions picked up rapidly from 2013-16, due to external demands: Thailand’s EGAT financed, contracted and now dispatches several new large hydro projects and a 2GW coal plant. As Thailand has become satiated, build has levelled off slightly."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand has surged as Laos has extended its electric grid into the reaches of its countryside, with peak load nearly doubling since 2010 and overall generation (much of which is exported) tripling over the same time frame. Laos aims to reach 98% of household electrification by 2020; it is well on its way, according to official statistics, with 94% electrification in 2017, compared to only 15% in 1995. Concerns remain, however, on the quality of the power supply to rural areas, and many speculate that the true electrification rate remains around 70-80%. Off-grid systems are an option for the remaining households that the grid hasn’t yet reached, but the remoteness of these homes means that income-generating opportunities – and therefore, the ability to pay for solar home systems – remain limited. Most solar home systems to date have effectively been given as grants."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"At present, project development in Laos is effectively on hold as the government assesses the risk of its existing and under-construction hydroelectric fleet, in response to the dam collapse at the Xe-pian Xe-namnoy project in July 2018. The government is unlikely to prioritize solar projects during this time. Meanwhile, offtaker risk remains a significant obstacle to new projects of all types: projects with an EDL offtake are considered unbankable due to the utility’s financial difficulties. Projects for the Thai market have been more successful because EGAT, Thailand’s utility, is considered a credit-worthy offtaker; however, as EGAT’s supply has slowly caught up with electricity demand, its interest in Lao projects has levelled off. This means many new projects will likely face an EDL or EVN (Vietnam’s utility) offtake, which will make financing more difficult."}]}
