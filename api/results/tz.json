energy policy","value":"The government updated the Power System Master Plan in December 2016. This lays out several scenarios for the development of Tanzania’s electricity industry and is currently the most prioritized long-term plan for the country. Its renewable energy target is very modest, at 5% in generation by 2040 – and the country appears to prioritize large hydro and fossil fuel generation. For small-scale projects, Tanzania has one of the most robust regulatory and legal frameworks in the region and encourages their construction. Projects will earn a fixed tariff for the lifetime of the PPA and the selection method will vary by technology. In September 2018, the country announced its first auction to construct solar and wind projects."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy investments in Tanzania have been sporadic, with a total amount of $248 million between 2010 and 2Q 2018. Nearly half of this is VC/PE finance for the off-grid solar companies such as Off-Grid Electric. Inconsistency in multiple long-term plans, lack of supporting mechanisms, and the high offtaker risk might have hindered investments into utility-scale renewable energy projects. The current trend is expected to continue as long as these challenges remain, and the administration maintains its priority on large-hydro and fossil fuel generation over renewables."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Fundamentally, retail electricity rates are set too low and are not cost reflective. The average tariff was 215 Tanzanian shillings ($0.10)/kWh in 2017, lower than the other East African nations such as Kenya and Rwanda. The current president is eager to keep the electricity price low for Tanzania’s industrialization. Tanzania Electric Supply Co. (Tanesco), the state-owned utility, submitted a request to the Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority (Ewura) in October 2016 to increase its average electricity tariff by 18%. Ewura approved an increase of just 8%. However, this had not been implemented as of June 2018."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Tanzania’s power sector is dominated by Tanesco, which owns most of the country’s transmission and distribution network and more than half of its generating capacity. In the 2016/17 financial year, Tanesco’s contribution reached 75% of generation, followed by Songas’ 20%. The government plans to reform the power sector by unbundling Tanesco by 2025, according to the 2014 Electricity Supply Industry Reform Strategy and Roadmap. However, achieving this will be hard within the prescribed timelines. The country’s two dominant generation sources are gas and hydro, which accounted for 59% and 35% of the total electricity generation of 7,100GWh in 2016/17. The contribution of renewable energy, meanwhile, was very limited."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Tanzania’s power demand has grown relatively slowly over the past several years. Peak power demand increased by only 1% in 2016/17, reaching 1,051MW. This is well below 1,450MW, the base-case power demand scenario, in the government’s Power Systems Master Plan 2016. The country has a binding target of electrifying all the public facilities such as schools, hospitals and churches by 2021 (100% village electrification), which may bring opportunities for on-site solar or mini-grids in off-grid areas. As of February 2018, some 36% of Tanzania’s 12,248 villages had access to electricity, according to the Rural Energy Agency."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"An issue holding back investment in power plant projects is the high offtaker risk caused by Tanesco’s huge debt. Fundamentally, retail electricity rates are set too low to unlock generation opportunities upstream. Although Tanzania has an import-duty exemption for PV equipment under the East African Community, the off-grid solar sector in particular is facing challenges of inconsistent policy implementation on the ground. Some tax officers have limited understanding of energy equipment, including solar home systems, leading to unnecessary tax payments."}]}
