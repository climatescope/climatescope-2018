energy policy","value":"The Sultanate has legally bound the state utility to ensure that at least 10% of electricity generation be derived from renewable resources by 2025. Oman has not implemented any other renewable energy incentives. A lack of legislation promoting clean energy notwithstanding, progress is being made toward reaching the 2,500MW to 3,000MW of capacity required to meet this goal. The Oman Power and Water Procurement Co. (OPWP) is overseeing the construction of a 50MW wind farm and the last bidding round for a 500MW solar project. The OPWP has, thus far, procured renewables projects through a tendering mechanism."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Work started on the aforementioned 50MW wind farm in August 2017. Early 2018 saw 28 companies bidding in an initial tendering round for the 500MW PV plant – the final stage will be held by the year’s end. In October 2018, the OPWP announced a 500MW-1GW solar project by issuing a consultancy tender for the so-called Solar 2022 IPP. Encouraging participation from domestic IPPs, the regulatory authority launched the Sahim initiative, which aims to install rooftop PV on 10-30% of Oman’s residential buildings. Successive annual solar tenders are to be issued from here on out, with capacities starting at 500MW. The OPWP also intends to attract bids for 150-200MW wind projects."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"The OPWP’s bulk supply tariff, which sets the price at which electricity is sold to licensed suppliers, averaged out at about 18.25 riyals/MWh ($47.40 based on the average 2017 exchange rate) for the country’s main grid network in 2017. Retail prices have not changed since 1992. The introduction of a cost-reflective tariff (CRT) in January 2017 is a notable exception, removing subsidies for customers whose yearly use exceeds 150MWh. The CRT’s incorporation of peak pricing is intended to even out demand. Despite such reforms and the fact that rates remain higher than the GCC average, the government continues to sell gas to power generators at prices kept well below international market rates."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Natural gas accounted for over 97% of all generation in 2017, and diesel-fired production made up much of the remainder. Installed solar capacity consists of a 300kW project and a handful of mostly rooftop PV systems. Several IPPs are involved in generation, but procurement, transmission and distribution are respectively controlled by the OPWP, the state-managed Oman Electricity Transmission Co., and joint-stock distribution companies under the publicly owned Nama group. A notable exception is the PDO – the Sultanate’s largest (largely state-owned) oil producer – which issued a 100MW PV tender in January 2018 under which it is to procure electricity through a 23-year PPA. Although 400MW of interconnection capacity allows for imports from the U.A.E., the transmission line is rarely used."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The country’s power fleet is well maintained and its rural regions electrified. Peak demand is expected to increase at around 9% per year in line with the economy’s robust growth, with consumption increasing for both residential and industrial users. Moreover, net metering is being explored through a pilot scheme, which could encourage further growth in rooftop solar installations alongside a better management of residential electricity use, which currently makes up 46% of demand. The Authority for Electricity Regulation (AER) has identified solar as an area of particular potential, and renewables have been given the green light by Sultan Qaboos with the creation of the region’s only dedicated Ministry for Environment and Climate Affairs."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Quotas set through labor nationalization measures designed to reduce the economy’s reliance on immigrant workers may slow down project implementation. Yet such ‘omanization’ rates are not significant enough to prove a major hurdle to future renewables deployment. Although import duties are not waived for renewable energy equipment, these are relatively low, at less than 10%. The country has few barriers to overcome, with a well-developed regulatory body in the AER overseeing the sector’s development. The launch of a spot market in 2019-2020 may change things, but there is little in the way of offtaker risk at present – the well-capitalized OPWP procures all electricity generated by IPPs."}]}
