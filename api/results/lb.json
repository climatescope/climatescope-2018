energy policy","value":"Lebanon aims to generate 12% of electricity from renewable sources by 2020 under the National Renewable Energy Action Plan. It has made headway toward this target, with 380MW of solar and wind projects signing PPAs to date. However, it will need a timely commission of its second phase of wind and solar projects to meet its 2020 target. The 300MW solar and 200-400MW wind projects in this phase are receiving requests for proposals as of 3Q 2018. Government support for renewables is stable – the elections in 2018 maintained the political status quo. The downside to this is that there is little chance the severe underinvestment and frequent blackouts that plague the power sector will be addressed soon."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The current pipeline of renewables projects will ensure strong growth in the sector in Lebanon. Following the signature of PPAs for 180MW of solar in 2017, the PPAs for the first 200MW of wind  developed in the country were signed in February 2018 at a price of $113/MWh. The next solar auction will add a further 300MW and will include battery storage. The Lebanese Centre for Energy Conservation received 75 expressions of interest for this project, including both local and major international developers such as ACWA Power, First Solar and Tesla, amongst others. The next phase of 200-400MW of wind projects received 42 EOIs by the deadline in April 2018. Investment in the first round of auctions has come mostly from domestic sources.  The National Renewable Energy Action Plan targets $ 1.7 billion of investment to develop the renewables sector."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"The government subsidizes electricity prices in the form of cheap diesel and heavy fuel oil for the state utility, Electricité du Liban (EDL), which sells electricity to the grid significantly below its cost of generation. The World Bank estimates that this massive strain on public finances is responsible for 40% of all government debt since 1992, two years before retail tariffs were frozen. However, any movement toward more cost-reflective power prices remains politically untenable. EDL’s inability to meet electrical demand has spawned a large fleet of private diesel generators. These supply the grid during the daily blackouts, which may last three hours in Beirut and up to 12 hours in rural areas. Despite their illegality, these generators contribute an estimated 23% of all electricity. The PPA for the first round of wind auctions was at $113/MWh. The LCOE of solar PV in Lebanon will likely be competitive in the context of the country’s diesel-dominated power sector. By 2016, small-scale PV solutions already totaled 20MW, with at least a further 10MW in development."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"EDL has a monopoly on transmission and distribution and retail of electricity. Any reforms to EDL or the power market are unlikely in the current political stalemate. Diesel and heavy-fuel generation dominate Lebanon’s power mix, in the form of ageing plants, leased power ships, or illegal private generators. The country imports some electricity from the Syrian interconnector. The law authorizing IPPs is still pending implementation; however, an exceptional decree granting the executive temporary powers to license new projects introduced in 2014 has made possible the current auction pipeline."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Lebanon’s power demand is difficult to estimate as much as much of it is unmet or provided by the fleet of black-market diesel generators. In recent years, an estimated 490MW of additional demand has come from the 1.5 million Syrian refugees present in the country. Forecast demand growth is modest, however, significant investment is required before current demand can be met. Lebanon enjoys high electrification rates and has few off-grid developments, although this sector represents opportunities to reduce dependence on the chronically unreliable grid. In terms of natural resource, Lebanon has abundant solar potential and previous studies have suggested wind potential between 1.5GW to 6GW of capacity."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"In some regards, barriers to renewable investment in Lebanon remain low; so far no tenders have stipulated local content requirements, there are no restrictions on foreign investment, and renewable energy equipment does not attract import duties or tariffs (but it is subject to Lebanese sales tax). The country has some manufacturing capacity, but most renewables equipment will likely remain imported. In contrast to this, considerable red tape surrounds the current IPP tendering procedures and political considerations can increase the time taken to reach decisions. Finally, offtaker risk could be considerable, given the poor financial situation of EDL, in addition to curtailment risks in the form of transmission and distribution constraints in the underfunded grid"}]}
