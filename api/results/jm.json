energy policy","value":"Jamaica seeks to decrease its oil dependency and improve its energy security by diversifying its electricity mix. It was the Caribbean’s first country to hold clean energy-only auctions. The country’s National Energy Plan 2009-2030 calls for 20% of its electricity generation to come from renewable sources by 2030. Private utility Jamaica Public Service (JPS) has responsibility for generation, transmission, and distribution on the island (the government owns 20% of the company). Other players may enter the market as independent power producers (IPPs) and sell electricity to JPS."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Jamaica attracted $0.4 billion in new-build clean energy investment over 2010-17. Wind energy was responsible for the highest investment in this period ($187 million), followed by solar with $134 million. Wind investment peaked in 2015 after renewable energy auctions, which commissioned 60MW of wind plants and one 20MW PV plant."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"In 2017, Jamaica’s residential and commercial electricity prices were the highest in the region. Its industrial average price is the second highest in Latin America. The residential price increased 18%, from $243.17 in 2016 to $286.91 in 2017, while the commercial price increased 20% over the period. The industrial price increased 25%, from $167.12 in 2016 to $208.57 in 2017."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"In 2017, almost 90% of Jamaica’s total 4.7TWh of electricity production came from  fossil fuel plants. Renewable energy (small hydro, solar and wind) accounted for the remaining 10%. Clean energy capacity started increasing in 2016, when auction-winning projects came online. Among the winners, wind plants with combined capacity of 60MW and one 20MW PV plant were commissioned in 2016. A 37MW PV project located in Westmoreland Parish is expected to be online by early 2019. Private utility Jamaica Public Service (JPS) is in charge of 60% of generation and 100% of transmission and distribution services on the island."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"According to the Ministry of Science, Energy and Technology (MSET), the national electrification rate in 2015 was 97%. Jamaica’s peak demand has remained somewhat stable over the past eight years. It has inched up only 4% over the period, from 638MW in 2010 to 667MW in 2017, which represents an average growth rate of just 0.5% per year."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Formal barriers to development of renewables in Jamaica are low. Consumers with their own generation facilities may participate in Jamaica Public Service’s net metering pilot program. They receive JPS’s avoided-cost rate plus 15% for electricity delivered to the national grid. As of May 2015, a total of 118 consumers with renewable energy self-generation facilities were connected to the grid. Jamaica has a zero rated value added tax (VAT) for components needed to build a solar or wind project."}]}
