energy policy","value":"Mali has no grid-scale renewable capacity except for hydro, which accounts for 40% of the current capacity, down from 60% in 2010. The country's target for 2020 and 2030 is also 60% of the total capacity, hydro included, with an increasing share planned for PV. However, specific policies to incentivize the sector are lacking. In 2015, the government launched two tenders for 75MW of PV, but no further auctions have been announced. Mali has a vibrant off-grid sector, with numerous isolated grids operated by local private operators. The investment costs are subsidized at 75% on average by the rural electrification agency. In theory, such subsidies should incentivize the use of capital-intensive technologies such as solar. However, most operators are relying on diesel, although an increasing number of hybrid systems are being deployed."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The only grid-scale clean power plants commissioned since the 1980s are two hydro plants developed by Sogem, the only IPP in Mali. A few other projects have reached financial close, including a 50MW PV plant, financed through a mix of private foreign investment and international commercial loans, with one local bank also participating. The other projects are hydro plants and will be financed through a mix of grants, state funding and loans from institutions such as the World Bank. For off-grid projects, up to 80% of capital investment is subsidized, but the rest often comes directly from the operator's own funds rather than from bank loans. The mini-grid market has grown from almost nothing to more than 50 operators since 2003."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Mali is a landlocked country that relies heavily on fossil fuel imports. Production costs are high, and the utility is running at a deficit despite subsidies from the state. The average cost for delivering electricity to the end-users was estimated at $0.25/kWh in 2016, more than the double the worldwide average. The electricity tariff was $0.16/kWh on average, so was not cost reflective. Retail tariffs have been relatively stable since 2004, with only slight increases in 2009 and 2014."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Mali's electricity market has been unbundled legally since 2000, but in practice the utility has a regional concession on transmission and distribution which covers 98 municipalities. Generation is open to competition, although there is currently only one IPP, Sogem. Some 60% of the grid-connected capacity comes from state-owned heavy fuel oil plants. The rest is hydro capacity, composed mainly of two dams managed by Sogem that also provide electricity to Senegal and Mauritania. Mali also imports electricity from Cote d'Ivoire and Senegal, and soon will do so from Mauritania. Since 2003, authorizations can be obtained for the retail of electricity in rural areas not reached by the grid. In September 2015, 68 local private operators were operating in 215 municipalities, mostly using diesel technology but increasingly hybrid systems."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Between 2005 and 2015, electricity sales in Mali grew by 8% annually on average. It is estimated sales will jump fourfold by 2025 compared with 2015, and annual growth of 15% is expected, mainly driven by low and high voltage clients. Electrification in rural areas is still very low, but grew from 1% in 1995 to 17% in 2017, mainly through the deployment of diesel-backed mini-grids operated by private local players. Solar/diesel hybrid plants are increasingly being deployed. The rural electrification agency is responsible for providing those operators with both grants and authorization, making the process of setting up a mini-grid efficient, although not always transparent."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Mali has little experience in renewables other than hydro, and policies for incentives are lacking. The generation market is dominated by two players, including the utility, and there are few general standards and procedures for grid-scale projects. The country has a dynamic mini-grid market, although private players must be established locally before participating. There are also significant challenges over tariffs in rural areas, which are around three times higher than the tariff of the utility, which sells power at below cost. Local consumers struggle to understand this difference and developers sometimes face violent reactions. Furthermore, the rural electrification agency plays a central role in the off-grid market, distributing both grants and authorizations. This has eased administrative procedures and contributed to the success of the market, although the lack of transparency is sometimes criticized."}]}
