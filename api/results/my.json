energy policy","value":"Malaysia introduced a feed-in tariff mechanism in 2011 and five years later announced the first competitive large-scale solar auction program. Both have been successful in promoting renewable energy generation. In contrast, the net-metering scheme has done very little to promote rooftop solar developments because of the very low retail electricity tariffs. The new government has yet to announce official renewables targets, and the delay has pushed back the announcement of a widely anticipated third large-scale solar auction. The Sustainable Energy Development Authority is preparing a new renewable energy transition road map for 2025, which is expected to push a more ambitious renewable energy target and streamline many of the existing policies, institutions and mechanisms."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Tax and financing incentives, like the Green Technology Financing Scheme, have contributed to the growth of clean energy investments. As of last year, 3.5 billion ringgit ($840 million) was approved to support 319 projects under the financing scheme. An additional 5 billion ringgit ($1.2 billion), approved in May 2018, is now available for investments over the next five years. In June 2017, the country also issued the world’s first green sukuk (Islamic) bond, which was used to finance large-scale solar projects awarded under the first auction for that technology. Solar projects continue to garner the most interest, and biogas and small hydro have good potential, whilst biomass consists of mostly legacy assets. Foreign involvement in the second solar auction increased, but limited foreign capital makes its way in as ownership limitations have deterred foreign participants from investing heavily."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Malaysian residential electricity prices are among the cheapest in the region at $50/MWh, while commercial and industrial tariffs are slightly higher, ranging between $88 and $101 per MWh. Power prices were last increased in 2014. Ongoing initiatives to deregulate the power sector and reduce gas price subsidies will have a knock-on impact on electricity tariffs. Residential prices, however, are unlikely to increase substantially given the political ramifications, especially with a government in its infancy. Malaysia's levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) across different technologies has been going down or at least remained flat, with the exception of gas. The country's lowest renewables LCOE is for small hydro, followed by geothermal and solar."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Fossil fuels dominate Malaysia's energy mix at 87% of generation, with gas and coal leading the way. This trend is set the change as the newly elected government seeks to reduce the nation's dependence on coal and drive an ambitious green agenda. Malaysia's power sector is highly regulated and dominated by three state-owned utilities. A small number of IPPs operate, mostly focused on fossil fuels. Growth in renewables capacity was 4% over the last five years, led by solar after the introduction of the large-scale solar auctions. The new administration is on course to improve transparency in the power sector, stomping out the practice of direct awards/negotiations with large players and promoting competitive bidding."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Malaysia's power demand has grown around 19% over the past five years, with an electrification rate of nearly 100%. There is room for enhancing rural electrification though, especially in the Bornean states of Sabah and Sarawak – one of the main goals of the Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy (SCORE) initiative. Being the third-largest PV cell producer in the world, Malaysia has homegrown expertise across the entire value chain, making it an environment conducive for solar players to operate. The largest potential lies with rooftop solar, but until a new mechanism to replace the existing net-metering program can be introduced, this is unlikely to take off. The government fully supports increasing investments in renewable energy as it helps to spur economic growth and employment."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Renewable assets in the country must be majority-owned by a local company, and feed-in tariff projects do receive bonus tariffs if components are sourced locally. There are no import levies on components, but a new service and sales tax was introduced for manufacturers in September. Though Malaysia experienced a major upheaval in government in the May 2018 general election, political instability is unlikely to impede the nation's push toward clean energy. Land for large-scale projects is a growing constraint as much of the available acreage is high-value agricultural land. Multiple authorities oversee different aspects of the renewable energy industry, occasionally creating blurred lines of accountability on renewable energy targets and goals."}]}
