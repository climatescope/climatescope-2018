energy policy","value":"Togo passed its first renewable energy development law in July 2018, setting out to reach 50% renewables in the national energy mix by 2030 from 15% today (including hydro). The government also published a roadmap to reach 100% electrification by the same year from a national average of 37% in 2017, which includes the addition of 108MW of solar and hydro capacity on the network, 315 mini-grids and the distribution of 550,000 solar kits all through public-private patnerships. While this is an ambitious target, Togo’s national political will to become energy independent and electrified should help to carry the sector. The country is in the process of setting up an open, transparent and easy-to-navigate regulatory framework. The renewables law comes a year after the launch of the AT2ER (Agence Togolaise d’Electrification Rurale et des Energies Renouvelables), which will lead and guide the development of renewable energy projects."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"While Togo has no utility-scale clean energy projects as yet, existing rural electrification programs have attracted both international concessional finance and domestic commercial finance. The Cizo electrification program has received the support of local bank Union Togolaise de Banque (UTB). Furthermore, the World Bank is involved with reinforcing grid capacity in Lomé and has contributed to the electrification roadmap. Togo hopes to see investment grow in the coming years to accompany the renewables law and contribute to reaching the ambitious target. The country expects in particular to attract foreign private investment."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Togo’s retail electricity prices are similar to those in neighboring country Benin, between $150-180/MWh. On average the prices in dollars have gone down since 2010, mainly due to currency fluctuation. The only tariff change observed since 2010 was an increase for the residential sector in 2011. The country hopes that building its local energy generation capacity will reduce cost of electricity further."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Togo’s generation is mainly thermal, as it relies on a 100MW ContourGlobal fossil fuel generation plant in Lomé, as well as imports (mostly gas from Ghana and Nigeria). The country aims to reach electricity independence by 2030. While there has been no large-scale renewables project in Togo to date, the national electrification and energy independence plan relies heavily on renewables over the coming decade. Some 50MW of solar have been commissioned, as well as 60MW of hydropower in Tetetou, 24MW in Titira, and another 24MW in Sarakawa. Under the new renewable energy sector law, renewables benefit from priority dispatch and purchase obligation from the offtaker. While the power sector is officially open to all players, the CEB (Communauté Electrique du Bénin) still owns most generation capacity in the country, as well as transmission assets. The CEET (Compagnie Energie Electrique du Togo) is in charge of retail."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Togo has an electrification rate of just 11% in rural areas. The country has developed a roadmap for electrification to reach 100% of the population by 2030. The program combines the distribution of 550,000 solar kits, notably with partners such as BBOXX, developing 315 micro-grids, and extending the distribution grid to remote areas. Togo’s power demand has grown from 130MW to 193MW from 2010 to 2017. The country has not accompanied this growth with increased capacity yet, relying on imports from regional neighbors. The development of renewables will allow the country to match demand."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The country has limited energy-value-chain infrastructure, as no projects of scale have been developed so far. The new energy law has reduced import duties and tariffs, and encourages foreign capital to invest in Togo. Other than a steep learning curve ahead, there are no major political or economic risks in the country. Furthermore, the offtaker has a solid record of delivering payments accordingly. The national effort and emphasis on the energy sector development, carried by renewables, suggests bureaucracy should be transparent and in favor of project developers."}]}
