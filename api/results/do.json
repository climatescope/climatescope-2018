energy policy","value":"The Dominican Republic has set an ambitious target to get 25% of its electricity supply from clean energy by 2020. As of December 2017, 18% of the nation’s total 15.3TWh came from clean energy generation. The country also has a net metering program, which allows retail electricity consumers who have renewable self-generation facilities to interconnect with the distribution company, deliver surplus generation to the grid, and obtain a billing credit."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The Dominican Republic’s clean energy sector attracted $1 billion of investment over 2010-17. Wind energy accounted for the bulk of it, with $559 million, followed by solar with $256 million. Almost half ($260 million) of the wind investment was recorded in 2017 to finance two plants with a combined capacity of 97MW. Most renewable energy projects are financed by project developers and multilateral investment banks. Commercial banks have limited participation in the market."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"The Dominican Republic’s residential power prices remained relatively flat between 2014-2017, averaging $149/MWh. Commercial prices fell 22% over this period from $247/MWh in 2014 to $193/MWh in 2017. Average industrial prices decreased from $186/MWh in 2014 to $161/MWh in 2017, and wholesale prices also decreased over same period, from $156/MWh in 2014 to $94/MWh in 2017."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The Dominican Republic had 3.7GW of installed capacity in 2017. Oil and diesel are the main sources of electricity, accounting for 1.8GW, or approximately 50% of the total. Small hydro, wind, solar and biomass together account for 10% of the total. Although generation is open to private players, it remains dominated by state-owned assets. The distribution segment is divided into three public companies: Edeeste, Edenorte and Edesur. All state-owned companies are managed by the Corporación Dominicana de Empresas Eléctricas Estatales."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"In 2017, Dominican Republic’s electrification rate was 96%. Peak power demand jumped 87% over the past eight years, from 1,810MW in 2010 to 3,397MW in 2017, while generation grew 23% over the same period. The Dominican Republic’s official planning document estimates demand growth of 3-4% per year through 2030. With 18% of total electricity provided by renewable energy plants (including large hydro) in 2017, the country remains under its target of 25% of clean energy generation by 2020, though momentum appears to be in the right direction. A 58MW PV plant was commissioned in 2018 and another 183MW of wind and PV plants were financed over the course of the year."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Formal barriers to development of renewables in Dominican Republic are low. An incentive regime for the development of clean energy has been in place since May 2007, consistent with the national energy plan (the Plan Energético Nacional, or PEN). It includes an investment tax credit, external financing, tax reductions, and exemptions from taxes on the transfer of industrialized goods and services, as well as from import duties. Renewable energy generators have dispatch priority and open access to transmission and distribution."}]}
