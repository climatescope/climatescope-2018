energy policy","value":"Energy reforms in Mexico that have transformed the power sector have also included strong support for renewable energy. Mexico in 2012 established a mandate to generate 35% of power from clean sources by 2024. It set up a Clean Energy Certificates (CELs) market in 2014, the main incentive for clean energy. The clean energy target begins at 5% in 2018 and will increase gradually to 13.9% in 2022. Implementation of key policies remains a work in progress. The CELs market is scheduled to enter into force in 2018. Certificate market demand, essentially a proxy for the total GWh of renewable power that will need to be delivered for Mexico to meet its clean energy goals, is expected to total approximately 13.7 million CELs in 2018, rising to 16.5 million in 2019 and 21.4 million in 2020 according to projections from the Secretariat of Energy (SENER). Mexico held three successful long term renewables auctions over 2016-17, making headlines with record low prices and contracting a total of 19.8TWh of clean power, 1.8GW of firm capacity, and 20.6 million CELs. A fourth long-term auction is scheduled for December 2018."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"A substantial increase in opportunities brought about by energy reform has transformed Mexico into a leading destination for new clean energy investment. The second largest power market in Latin America, Mexico’s installed renewables capacity represents 9% of its 76GW total. This share is expected to increase as a result of new investment in the country’s excellent solar and wind resources, as well as auction mechanisms put in place by energy reform. Clean power investments jumped more than sixfold from 2016 to 2017, to $6.2 billion. Mexico’s financing landscape is diverse, with project developers, commercial banks and development banks all playing important roles. Wind projects, in particular, have been historically successful in attracting investment. Rapid cost declines for both wind and solar have been seen in recent years, a trend that is expected to continue and which will pressure the country’s growing natural gas sector."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"The Mexican market is characterized by relatively high wholesale prices overall, with both day-ahead and real-time prices rising steadily. Day-ahead prices averaged 1.67 pesos/KWh ($0.088/KWh) in 2018 through August, approximately 33% higher than the 2017 average over the same period and nearly double those in 2016. A second phase of the short-term energy market featuring an hour-ahead market remains to be introduced. Off-takers with a load center of at least 1MW are classified as “qualified users” and are allowed to purchase electricity directly from qualified suppliers. There are now six such qualified suppliers active in the wholesale market, including CFE Calificados, the subsidiary of state power utility, Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE). CFE continues to be the supplier of basic retail services to residential customers and small and medium-sized commercial customers under regulated tariffs. Regulator CRE sets the final retail and last-resort supply tariffs based on the cost of energy and ancillary services required."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Mexico’s generation matrix is dominated by thermal sources, which represented approximately 81% of total generation in 2017, primarily natural gas and diesel. Hydro accounted for approximately 10% of generation, followed by nuclear and wind at 3% each. At year-end 2017, Mexico had 4.2GW of wind capacity commissioned, by far the largest renewable technology excluding large hydro, with total solar commissioned capacity standing at just 344MW. However, renewables dominate capacity additions. Through 2020, Mexico is expected to undergo a solar boom, with over 10GW added to the grid in addition to 7GW of wind. A fundamental change introduced by Mexico's energy reform is the separation of state-owned vertically integrated utility CFE, which holds the majority of generation assets and retains monopoly over transmission and distribution. Grid operation moved from within CFE to newly created, independent grid operator CENACE, which is to guarantee open and non-discriminatory access to transmission. Deregulation of generation in 2016 created Mexico’s wholesale market, which has operated on a day-ahead basis since January 2016, with the real-time spot market beginning in January 2017."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Business opportunities for renewable energy in Mexico have improved significantly, underpinned by an outlook of rising electricity demand, which has averaged annual growth of over 3% since 2010. Mexico’s three auctions held over 2016-17 have spurred investor interest in the country’s excellent wind and solar resources. Mexico has led Latin America in new clean energy investment since 2017, attracting nearly $2 billion in the first half of 2018, of which 70% of was directed towards solar. Large projects that secured contracts in the country’s first auction, held in March 2016, began to come online in 2018. In June 2018, Mexico announced the end of the 15% customs duty on solar PV module imports, introduced in 2015, removing a significant barrier to renewables development. Mexico is a potential market for distributed generation, with residential PV installation accelerating rapidly in recent years, reaching 434MW cumulatively at year-end 2017, the largest in Latin America. Retail electricity consumers in Mexico who have renewable energy or co-generation facilities can connect to the national grid, deliver surplus generation to it, and obtain billing credit for excess electricity provided."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"While Mexico's nearly-completed energy reform is increasing private participation in generation, the market remains highly concentrated in the hands of CFE, the state-owned, formerly vertically integrated utility. Diversification of certain areas of the competitive landscape, such as in qualified supply, is likely to take time. Investors are also wary of environmental and other regulatory risks in some areas of Mexico due to land disputes with indigenous communities, which remain an important barrier for project development in the country and a primary reason for project construction delays in specific regions, such as Yucatan. Additionally, there is some uncertainty around the CELS market ahead of its entry into force in 2018 and in particular, whether there will be sufficient clean energy capacity to generate quantities of CELs needed to comply with future requirements."}]}
