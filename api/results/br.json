energy policy","value":"Since 2009, Brazil has implemented reverse auctions to contract new clean energy generation capacity to supply the regulated utility market. The country has pioneered competitive auctions, which led to over 24.8GW of renewable energy contracted, despite a two-year tender hiatus between May 2016 and December 2017. Auctions started to pick up again in late 2017 and four rounds were held between December 2017 and August 2018. Significant competition among project developers caused by a lack of contracts over the period resulted in the lowest average wind auction price ever recorded in Brazil of $20.3/MWh in April 2018. In terms of other renewables incentives, retail electricity customers may install self-generation facilities, connect to the grid, deliver surplus generation and obtain compensation in the form of a subsequent billing credit."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Brazil attracted almost $57 billion in new asset finance for clean energy plants in 2010-17, by far the largest amount in Latin America over the period. Wind alone accounts for 56% of the total, while solar attracted just 6%. However this is due to increase as solar developers have secured almost 2GW in contracts in the 2017-18 auctions.  Brazilian national development bank BNDES has played a major role in the development of the country’s renewable energy market. The bank is the top global lender to clean energy, having disbursed $27 billion for renewable energy (excluding large hydro) projects between 2008 and 2017.  In addition, BNDES applies a strict local content requirement in granting wind and PV project loans, spurring equipment manufacturers to build factories in the country."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Retail electricity prices (in local currency terms) jumped on average 61% between 2010 and 2017, mainly due to inflation and decreases in hydropower generation. In 2017, residential tariffs were among the five highest in Latin America, at $200/MWh. Average commercial and industrial prices were $199/MWh and $170/MWh.  Commercial and industrial (C&I) customers with power demand greater than 500kW are eligible to purchase electricity from Brazil’s deregulated wholesale market. Consumers with demand between 500kW and 3MW choosing this option must purchase wholesale power generated from incentivized renewable sources, including wind, small hydro, biomass and solar."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Brazil has the largest power market in Latin America, with total installed capacity of 157GW in 2017. The country’s size, plentiful resources and conducive policies have made Brazil the region’s main renewable energy market and one of the top 10 in the world. Its matrix remains highly reliant on hydropower, which accounted for roughly 75-80% of the country’s generation in the past five years. The heavy reliance on one source came at a high cost in 2014: a prolonged drought put Brazil’s water supply and energy matrix into stress, exposing the market to costly generation from fossil-fueled plants. The hydro crisis emphasized the country’s need for generation diversification. Auctions and net metering will continue to be crucial policies to develop Brazil’s power sector. In terms of structure, the power market is fully unbundled and fairly evenly split between state-owned and private-sector players."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"After three years of economic crisis, Brazil’s GDP grew 1% in 2017, with the annual inflation rate declining from 8.77% in 2016 to 3.46% in 2017. The country continues to struggle to recover from its worst recession on record, navigating a tumultuous first half of 2018 marked by rising unemployment, a 10-day truckers’ strike that paralyzed the economy, and a polarized presidential election. As a result of the economic crisis, peak demand remained almost flat between 2014 and 2017, at 85.7GW."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"In October 2018, Brazil elected former military officer and far-right politician Jair Messias Bolsonaro of the Social Liberal Party (PSL) as its 42nd president. After an extremely polarizing campaign, the results represent a repudiation of traditional politics in the country and of entrenched corruption, as well as a reaction to high levels of violent crime and ongoing economic woes. Bolsonaro’s focus on the energy sector as a key driver of growth and development, as well as his emphasis on partially privatizing state-owned companies and regaining investor confidence could mean a bright future for renewables in the country. However, the former military man’s security ties may present barriers to new investment and limit privatization plans."}]}
