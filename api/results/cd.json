energy policy","value":"The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has done little to develop a clean energy policy, largely due to the political instability of the country following widespread conflict and civilian unrest. President Joseph Kabila’s refusal to leave office since his term ended in December 2016 has led to outbreaks of violence and intimidation against protestors and members of the opposition, so development of new policies is not of the highest priority. The DRC’s low energy requirement and dependence on hydropower is not conducive to the development of clean energy policy to encourage other renewables build. Tax incentives for renewable energy projects are the sole area where policy directly benefits the industry."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Investment in clean energy projects in the DRC has been limited for a number of reasons. Political instability and currency volatility do not create an environment conducive to foreign investment. The country’s domestic banking sector is also not well set up to provide commercial finance. Hydropower remains the dominant form of energy generation, given the country’s significant river resources - notably the Congo River. The few announced solar projects are small-scale and linked to commercial mining activities or the telecoms industry."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"The DRC has a regulated electricity tariff that has only marginally changed over the last few years. Residential customers are charged one of the lowest tariffs in the world, which dooes not even cover the utility’s (SNEL) operational costs. However, there have been recent increases to residential tariffs due to a devaluation in the Congolese franc, according to reports. There has been little change to the levelized costs of electricity in the DRC due to a lack of new projects being built. Most electricity is purchased by consumers at a fixed lump sum as meters are very scarce, leaving much at the discretion of officials. Furthermore, it is also common for public institutions (schools, health centers and public enterprises) to have large amounts overdue on their electricity bills."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Hydropower generates the vast majority of the DRC’s electricity needs and the Congo River has significant potential for further dam development. As yet, there are no utility-scale wind and solar projects, although there is some evidence that could change: Copperbelt Energy has announced plans for two PV plants to feed electricity to copper and cobalt mines in the country. Power generation still largely rests in the hands of state-controlled utility SNEL, which owns and operates 94% of installed capacity in the DRC. Independent power producers own just 6% of total generating capacity, at 135MW, which is mostly used for mining activities."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Mining activity will drive near-term growth in power demand in the DRC, in part due to the increase in global demand for specialty metals such as copper and cobalt that the country has in abundant supply. Copperbelt Energy’s plans to build two grid-connected solar PV projects for the mining sector are evidence of this. The government plan to triple the current national electrification rate to 32% by 2030 is likely to mean that favorable policies will be introduced for mini-grids or off-grid solar. However, continuing unrest, particularly in the lead-up to the elections in December 2018, may lead to power demand stagnation. Most DRC power plants are hydro-electric stations that do not require near-term upgrades."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Offtaker risk for power projects in the DRC is very high as SNEL, the state-owned utility, is not solvent. SNEL owns 94% of total installed capacity so the prospects for wind and solar developers to build new projects in the country are not very good, as a result of the high offtaker risk, currency volatility and political uncertainty. The DRC does not yet have any meaningful renewable energy incentives in place. Given the lack of utility-scale energy projects built in recent years, there would also be a substantial amount of red tape faced by developers. The DRC has no manufacturing capacity of any scale for its hydro or other renewable energy projects, so local content requirements do not exist. Smaller-scale companies also face import duties on off-grid solar products, unless they are granted an exemption."}]}
