energy policy","value":"Thailand is the regional leader in total installed renewable capacity in Southeast Asia. It was the first country in SEA to implement a feed-in premium intended to spur investment and development of renewable energy projects. The latest Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP) 2015-36 sets a target for renewables to account for 20% of generation by 2036. Specifically, Thailand aims to have 3GW of wind installations and 6GW of solar capacity by 2036. The generous feed-in premium and subsequent feed-in-tariff programs implemented by the government successfully supported the growth of the renewables industry. By end of 2017, cumulative installed solar capacity exceeded 3GW and wind capacity was around 800MW. With the long lead time to 2036, Thailand's current renewable energy target is well within reach."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Stimulated by the attractive feed-in premium, also known as the 'adder', introduced in 2007, renewable energy capacity has grown significantly. Between 2010 to 1H 2018, asset financing for renewable projects totaled $9.7 billion. Within two years from the release of the 2015 Power Development Plan (PDP), Thailand has achieved almost half of its 2036 renewable energy capacity target. Among all technologies, solar accounts for majority of the growth. In its infancy, there were concessional financing programs from Clean Technology Fund, Asian Development Bank and International Finance Corp. Over the years, Thailand's conglomerates actively participated in the development of renewables projects. Local commercial banks have supported the energy transition in Thailand, and as they familiarized themselves with the renewable technologies, actively financed projects in the country."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Thailand's retail tariffs consist of a base tariff that is reviewed every three to five years and an adjustment tariff component that is reviewed every four months. The adjustment tariff reflects changes in fuel costs, electricity purchase cost and the impact of government policies. The costs from various renewable energy schemes are passed through to retail consumers and have contributed to an increase in retail tariffs over the years. Compared to neighboring countries such as Malaysia and Vietnam, retail tariffs in Thailand are higher. A drop in equipment costs globally, the establishment of domestic equipment production bases and a reduction in development and balance-of-plant costs as developers gained experience, all contributed to a constant decline in the levelized cost of electricity for solar and wind in Thailand over time."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Thailand's power market is partially liberalized, with the generation sector opened up to the participation from private players. State-owned utility EGAT is the sole offtaker of all generated electricity. The introduction of Small Power Producers (SPPs) and Very Small Power Producers (VSPPs) promoted the decentralization of power generation utilizing renewable energy. Although the share of renewables in the generation mix increased to approximately 11% by end-2017, Thailand still mainly relies on natural gas and coal, which account for 68.5% and 20.2% of power generation, to meet most of its power demand. The power development plan of Thailand aims to reduce the country's dependence on natural gas power generation to 40% by 2036."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Thailand has achieved 100% electrification. In the 2015 PDP, total electricity demand is forecasted to increase at an average growth rate of 2.68% in the period 2014-36. Year-on-year percentage growth is expected to decrease. Average growth is estimated to be 3.43% over the period 2017-21 but drops to 2.66% for 2022-26. This is partly due to an expected increase in energy efficiency. To boost the development of the renewable energy industry, Thailand's Board of Investment has exempted such projects from import tariffs. The investment climate in Thailand is stable. There are no known defaults by the single offtaker, EGAT. The grid in Thailand is also relatively robust, with a few instances of supply interruptions and no known curtailment. There are no barriers to entry in the form of foreign ownership restrictions or local content requirements."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Thailand's power generation market is open to foreign investment. There is currently a halt on utility-scale project applications in 2016 causing a lack of large-scale opportunities in the country. Developers in Thailand are currently waiting for a revised PDP, expected to be released within 2018. Development activities are generally on hold until the new directive is announced by the government. Wind projects previously suffered a setback through the revocation of a land lease for Thep Sathit Wind Farm, which was developed by Energy Absolute. However, this has been resolved and wind projects have seen steady progress since."}]}
