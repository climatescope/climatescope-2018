energy policy","value":"The country has no specific clean energy policy. Indeed, it lacks a clear energy policy altogether, although it has tried to implement some plans in the past. In the 2011 'South Sudan Strategic Development Plan' a target of increasing electricity access from 22,000 to 48,000 customers was set out – a plan that was initially pencilled in to run from 2011-13. In 2013 it was extended to run until 2016, at which point a new five-year plan was to be deployed. However, the next five-year plan is yet to be announced by the government, largely due to the disruption caused by the ongoing civil war."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"There is a lack of access to grid infrastructure which has impeded any growth in clean energy investment. Of the money that has been invested, most of it has come from international aid organizations and foreign governments. The African Development Bank loaned South Sudan $26 million in 2013 to increase access to clean energy – a project that is ongoing – and in 2017 a further $14.7million was loaned to the country. More recently, a Chinese-funded electricity pole plant was commissioned that is expected to help boost grid infrastructure and provide greater access to clean energy in the capital, Juba. The construction of a transmission grid is likely to open up further opportunities to investors in clean energy."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"The government has only just re-started an electricity market following the collapse of an earlier attempt. The average tariff will be set at $0.42/kWh by the government, cheaper than both Uganda and Kenya. As the new electricity system is in its first year it is not clear how tariffs could change in the future."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"On-grid energy generation is dominated by fossil fuels, with power plants consisting of a mix of oil/diesel facilities with one small hydro facility in the capital, Juba. The majority of the population, 99%, is off-grid and relies on diesel generators for power. However, there is an increasing proportion of the population that is moving to clean energy for their off-grid power, with 15MW of clean energy off-grid projects reported. This is equal to half of the grid generators."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand in the country is growing, but the rate of growth is limited by a lack of transmission infrastructure. The power grid is currently confined to the three largest cities, Juba, Wau and Malakal. Those living in rural areas therefore have to make do with no electricity or must rely on diesel generators. A Chinese company has recently built an electricity pole manufacturing plant in Juba. The government hopes that this will enable electricity to reach 20% of the capital’s population by 2020, up from 5% today."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The lack of a transmission grid poses a serious barrier to both clean energy adoption and wider electrification. Outside of the three largest cities, people largely have to rely on diesel generators if they want access to electricity. The ongoing civil war and disputes within the government means that there is little policy in place to encourage further electrification or the adoption of clean energy. The civil war will also act as a deterrent to foreign investment."}]}
