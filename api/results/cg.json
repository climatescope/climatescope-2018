energy policy","value":"The Republic of the Congo has neither implemented any legislation intended to promote clean energy nor set a specific target for renewables deployment. Clean energy is relegated to the margins of the policy-making agenda, as the sector focuses on stamping out illegal connections, managing the emergence of a new state utility and maximizing the country’s large hydro potential."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"There has been no real investment in renewable energy to date. Finance for prospective renewables initiatives would likely come from international donors, with organizations such as the French Development Agency, the African Development Bank and the World Bank currently underwriting transmission and capacity-building projects through grants and loans dispensed at concessional rates. Any concrete developments in this area are limited to small hydro feasibility studies carried out by the UN Development Program and a handful of small-scale solar systems."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Retail power prices are lower than in neighboring Gabon, Cameroon and the Central African Republic, and are cheap when compared to the region as a whole. They are kept far below production costs by substantial subsidies: only tariffs in the Democratic Republic of Congo are lower. Another hurdle stymying investment is illegal connections, which are thought to siphon off 50% of the state utility’s output. Prices are unlikely to be increased in the near future, the focus being on getting the recently formed state utility on its feet while putting the screws on bill-dodging consumers. Only one IPP sells electricity, with the state utility purchasing electricity from Eni’s thermal plant at a rate of 45,000 CFA/MWh ($76.20 based on the average 2017 exchange rate)."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Much of the country’s capacity runs on fossil fuels. Its largest generation asset is Eni’s 300MW OCGT gas plant, Centrale Electrique du Congo (CEC). Large hydro provides a sizeable slice of generation with such dams as Imboulou (120MW) and Moukoukoulou (74MW). No non-hydro renewables capacity has been installed to date. Although generation was first opened up to private producers in 2003, an application decree outlining the law’s remit was not issued until July 2017. Even if the utility has agreed to buy electricity from Eni’s CEC plant, the state ensured it retained an 80% share of the project’s equity. The market’s lack of maturity is such that regulations concerning private generation remain unclear."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Mired in an economic crisis sparked by plummeting oil prices, the country has been teetering on the brink of insolvency since 2016. Congo’s business environment has taken a hit as a result, reducing the attractiveness of untested renewable energy investment. Moreover, the government appears more interested in spending what few resources it can muster on large hydro than in other renewables, despite the need to deploy off-grid solutions to electrify large swathes of the rural population. Even investment in the country’s dams, however, has been lacking. Although much of the current hydro fleet is decrepit, no concerted modernization plan is under way."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Equipment required for renewable energy projects is taxable through both import tariffs and VAT, increasing capital costs. Offtaker risk is another issue. Société Nationale d’Electricité, the national utility, was dissolved in July 2018 before being replaced by Energie Electrique du Congo (EDC). Alongside uncertainty regarding the reasons behind the utility’s dismantling, the transition has been plagued by confusion concerning the newly created company’s legal status and the transfer of assets from its defunct predecessor. Although talks with several candidates were under way, no bidder was found to take the reins through a management contract, leaving EDC to embark upon the long process of recapitalization and reform alone."}]}
