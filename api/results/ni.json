energy policy","value":"Nicaragua’s Ministry of Energy and Mines updated in January 2017 the Plan for Electric Generation Expansion 2016-2030 with a non-binding 73% renewables generation target (including large hydro) by 2030. The plan also establishes interim renewables goals of 55% by 2018 and 64% by 2023. In 2017, the country had reached a 56% share. Renewable energy developers enjoy a full range of tax breaks, including import duty, VAT and income tax exemptions."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Nicaragua attracted $942 million in new-build clean energy investment over 2010-16, but none was disbursed in 2017. Wind has accounted for the highest share claiming a third of the total, followed by small hydro with $218 million and geothermal with $215 million."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Electricity prices in Nicaragua have increased by less than 4% (in local currency terms)  over the past five years. Commercial electricity prices are the second highest in Latin America at $256/MWh, only after Jamaica. Residential and commercial tariffs are significantly lower at $194/MWh and $192/MWh, respectively, but still appear among the top seven most expensive tariffs in the region. Nicaragua’s high retail prices are largely due to its dependency on imported fossil fuels for generation. However, tariffs are not cost reflective. Renewables development is key to improving energy security and reducing generation costs."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Renewables account for the biggest share of power generation, reaching 56% of the 4.5TWh produced in 2017 – up from 47% in 2016. Fossil fuel plants were still responsible for a substantial share, but decreased from 52% in 2016 to 44% in 2017. Nicaragua's power sector is unbundled and distinct actors (both state- and privately owned) participate in the generation and distribution sectors. A total of 18 companies with active generation contracts and IPPs hold a large share of installed capacity."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Nicaragua’s peak power demand jumped 26% over 2010-17 to 680MW, rising 6% on average over the first two years of the period. However, growth then decelerated mainly due to an economy slowdown, reaching just 1% per year in 2015-17.

The exception is the series of tax incentives to ease the clean energy project development process. Import tax and VAT exemptions for machines, equipment, materials and inputs for investment and construction, including the sub-transmission lines required to transport electricity to the national grid, the Sistema Interconectado Nacional (SIN). The incentives, introduced in 2005, were initially to be in force for a period of 10 years and expire in May 2015. In December 2017, the national assembly approved the law reform in which extends the fiscal benefits until 2023."}]}
