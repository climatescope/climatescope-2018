energy policy","value":"Burkina Faso has a limited clean energy policy landscape. There is no auction program, feed-in tariff or net metering scheme in place. Some tenders have been announced for small-scale solar projects, but there is no program with a schedule of future tenders. Burkina Faso does have tax exemptions on solar equipment, which seems to attract investment around the capital in Ouagadougou, where dozens of small businesses sell and install solar panels for small-scale use. Burkina Faso aims to have an energy mix with 50% renewables by 2025, up from 24% in 2018. This would require roughly 150MW of renewables to be commissioned by the deadline compared with the pipeline at the time of writing of one 10MW PV plant that has secured financing."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The biggest new clean energy investment deals were for the 33MW Zagtouli PV plant, which commissioned in 2017, and the 15MW Essakane PV plant, which came online in 2018. Together, these deals totaled $115 million. The Zagtouli project, which signed a PPA with Sonabel, Burkina Faso’s utility, was financed by international donors. The Essakane plant has a PPA with gold miner Iamgold and is partly financed by Banque Internationale pour le Commerce, l’Industrie et l’Artisanat du Burkina (BICIAB), a BNP Paribas Group subsidiary, suggesting that commercial sponsors are also willing to invest in PV in Burkina Faso."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"The regulator ARSE sets a national fixed electricity tariff, with no distinction between the prices for commercial, industrial and residential users. The tariff has been stable over the last five years, but it is not cost reflective. Burkina Faso has one of the highest costs of electricity in the region, as it needs to import expensive diesel to run its thermal power plants. As electricity tariffs do not recover costs, Sonabel relies on government subsidies and has been incurring losses since 2011."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Generation is dominated by thermal plants that are fueled by expensive imported oil. In recent years Sonabel has tried to keep up with rising demand by ramping up generation of existing fossil fuel plants, and by importing electricity from Ghana, Togo and Cote d’Ivoire. Imports rose from 145GWh in 2009 to 434GWh in 2017. The power sector is partly liberalized. The country is divided in two segments: The first covers the urban areas where Sonabel has a monopoly over transmission and distribution. Although generation is open to private actors, no IPPs are active. The second segment covers rural areas, where local cooperatives (COOPELs) are responsible for distribution. In this segment the private sector may operate generation and off-grid distribution projects. The offtaker can be commercial, as in the case of the Essakane PV plant."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand has been rising rapidly, with peak demand growing on average by 13% a year since 2010. Electrification has barely kept up with growing demand: The electrification rate is 21% and in rural areas it is almost non-existent (2%). Burkina Faso has great solar and hydro resources, but as a landlocked country it has limited wind potential. The low rural electrification rate and high solar resources offer an opportunity for off- and mini-grid PV projects. Mini-grids can be owned and operated by private actors, while developers of installations over 25kW need a concession, which is controlled by ARSE."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"With Burkina Faso being one of the poorest countries in the world, the state of the infrastructure is bad. The main grid is unreliable and congested, and blackouts are common. The country is politically relatively unstable, and in 2015 a military coup caused unrest across the country. Potential IPPs in the urban-based segment are obliged to sign a PPA with Sonabel, although the utility is heavily in debt and cannot pay for grid maintenance and fleet modernization. Alternatively, project developers that wish to set up a mini-grid have to deal with a fair amount of bureaucracy: a project larger than 10kW requires administrative approval and requires an authorization from the Ministry of Energy, if it services more than 10 clients."}]}
