energy policy","value":"Burundi has committed unconditionally to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 3% compared to a business-as-usual scenario for 2030, as part of its nationally determined contribution. The focus of Burundi’s Electricity Law, last updated in 2015, is on rehabilitation of existing hydropower plants and distribution grids as well as the development of new hydro sites. The country’s rural electrification program is planned mainly around grid extensions and providing information on alternative energy sources affordable for low-income households. The only effective support for renewables developers in Burundi is that equipment benefits from import tariff exemptions. There are no fiscal incentives or other policy instruments such as feed-in tariffs. Auctions were held in 2013 and 2014 but these are not regular and there are no further rounds planned. There are no specific legal tools to discourage fossil fuels."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"There has been significant under-investment in the energy sector over the last 20 years. As a result, the country has a relatively weak electrification rate of 8% nationally and 2% in rural areas, so there is significant scope for investment. The country has also opened its energy sector to privatization. Uptake of this opportunity has been limited, but one notable investment in 2017 included a 7.5MW solar plant. This was accompanied by a 25-year PPA, signed between the developer Gigawatt Global and the national utility, Regideso. Other foreign investment in the energy sector in Burundi has primarily been made by the World Bank, the African Development Bank, UNDP and European Investment Bank. Investment in rural electrification is being undertaken by the Burundian Agency for Rural Electrification, established by decree in 2011. The objective of this entity is to develop and implement rural electrification projects, including small-scale hydropower, solar and wind energy."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Electricity tariffs are set by the monopoly electricity supplier, Regideso. Power prices are extremely high, considering the high proportion of hydro, with average tariffs being among the world's most expensive. The growing gap between power supply and demand that is driving these high prices is largely due to grid inefficiencies and a lack of investment into new infrastructure. There is also a heavy reliance on expensive fossil fuel imports to run the thermal power plant in the capital, as no indigenous sources are available. This drives prices up due to import taxes and limited access to foreign currency reserves – and black market exchange rates are prohibitively high. This also affects companies and consumers when they run diesel generators during blackouts. A number of Burundi’s businesses are currently self-generating their energy using expensive firewood or peat, and have great interest in sourcing renewables to reduce costs."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The renewable energy mix is dominated by hydro (49%), followed by solar (19%). In September 2017, the government leased an emergency 30MW natural gas power station for the supply of the capital Bujumbura. The city accounts for 95% of electricity consumed. Aside from its national generation capacity, Regideso also buys electricity from an old cross-border hydropower complex located in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) with 70MW shared among Rwanda, DRC and Burundi. The national average electricity consumption per capita is only 25kWh per year, which is one of the lowest rates in the world. Power generation continues to be dominated by Regideso, which has a legal monopoly (renewed in 2015 for 25 years) for electricity transmission, distribution and supply. The generation capacity is owned and operated by Regideso and subject to severe under-investment, as is the case for the transmission and distribution assets, much of which date from before the country's independence in 1962."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world and relies on foreign aid, which accounts for over half of the government budget. The country has only just emerged from two decades of civil war and is hampered by political tensions, corruption and inefficient bureaucracy that significantly adds to the cost of trade. In 2012, it ranked 131st out of 132 countries in the World Economic Forum (WEF) Enabling Trade Index, Several non-tariff barriers hamper private sector growth, including weak infrastructure, high corporate taxes and a lack of access to long-term credit. Nevertheless, Burundi has a relatively open trade regime, which aligns with the country’s Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy. As a part of regional integration strategy, Burundi joined the East African Community (EAC) in 2007 and began implementing the common external tariff (CET) in 2009. Burundi also made major reforms in 2011 to improve the procedure for creating a business, simplify construction permitting and ensure better investor protection."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The main barrier to private sector participation is that any large capital program will face a heightened risk of unforeseen events due to the deteriorating internal security in Burundi or unrest in neighboring countries. Until recently, no consistent and coordinated government energy efficiency programs had been launched since the end of Burundi's long-term conflict. As a result, energy efficiency is facing barriers at all levels due to low awareness for energy efficient products and appliances, and a lack of quality technical and service standards for energy efficient equipment. More generally in the electricity sector, there is insufficient management experience and a lack of access to investment finance to deliver new projects. There is also growing concern over the severe constraints in the electricity supply, involving frequent power outages. The supply deficit currently varies between about 15MW during the wet season and 25MW during the dry season, when the country’s main hydropower plants run at reduced capacity."}]}
