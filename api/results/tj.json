energy policy","value":"Tajikistan generates less than 2% of its power from renewable energy sources other than large hydro, but the country aims to increase this figure to 20% by 2030. To support this goal, the government has called for the construction of small hydro and solar power plants and granted VAT and excise duty exemptions to renewable energy investors. The country’s small hydro and solar markets have yet to take off, but its utilization of clean energy remains notable. Large hydro, for example, accounts for over 80% of Tajikistan’s installed power capacity."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Tajikistan has not seen any serious investment in clean energy. Though the government has called for the construction of small hydro and solar power plants, the country’s installed capacity for small hydro remains less than 300MW and no new solar plants have come online. Still, international development banks and public-private partnerships are making some progress. The Asian Development Bank approved a $10 million grant in 2013 to support green energy solutions in households and Pamir Energy, a public-private partnership, is investing in small hydro projects in rural parts of the country."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Tajikistan, like most former Soviet Union countries, has low power prices due to government subsidies. Still, its electricity rates are higher than those in Kyrgyzstan and have been increasing for the past several years. The government has raised rates in an effort to improve the financial health of its main energy company, Barqi Tojik, but not all tariffs have increased. The Tajik Aluminum Co., for example, still has access to a special, subsidized electricity rate, even though it accounts for almost 20% of the country’s power consumption."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Barqi Tojik, a vertically integrated state-owned utility, dominates Tajikistan’s power sector. Despite its strong market position, the utility is in poor financial health due to low subsidized tariffs, losses on transmission and distribution services and mediocre collection rates. The government has granted Pamir Energy the authority to provide power generation, transmission, distribution and retails sales in one remote region, but Barqi Tojik acts as the utility for over 95% of the country’s population. Industrial players consume most of Tajikistan’s power."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Despite its near 100% electrification rate, Tajikistan suffers from power reliability issues due to its dependence on large hydropower plants (most of which are operating beyond their intended operating life). Still, these same large hydro plants also provide the country with an oversupply of power in summer months, so Tajikistan is an active participant in the CASA 1000 project, a new transmission line that aims to better connect the country with Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Tajikistan has experienced high GDP growth for the past five years, and peak power demand has increased moderately."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"There are numerous barriers to renewable energy development in Tajikistan, and market growth beyond the government’s goals remains unlikely. While the government has introduced some polices to support the renewables industry, it has not introduced a feed-in tariff or auctions program. In addition to the country’s isolation and lack of domestic renewables manufacturing capacity, there are other issues such as the high cost of credit (which is approximately 24-26% APR) and the lack of interest from foreign developers in entering the market. The country’s regulatory environment is also complex, and Tajikistan ranks near the bottom of the World Bank’s ease of doing business ranking."}]}
