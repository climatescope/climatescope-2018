energy policy","value":"The government aims to reach 20% renewable energy generation by 2023 and 30% by 2030 – a significant leap from the 2017 share of 4.2%. The most important legal foundation was laid by the Law on Renewable Energy (2007), as well as the National Renewable Energy Program (2005-20), which provided official targets and incentives for global investors in the sector. The principal incentive is the relatively generous feed-in tariff: the price paid under the power-purchase agreement (PPA) is negotiated with the National Dispatching Center – such feed-in tariffs are denominated in U.S. dollars and paid in Mongolian tugrik based on current exchange rates, helping with elimination of currency risk. Tax exemptions are also made available for PV and wind turbines."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Mongolia could supply 8,000TWh of wind power and 5,000TWh of solar power per year. However, renewable energy investment began relatively slowly, amounting to just $200 million over 2010-16. Then 2017 set a new annual record, at nearly $100 million, with the trend extending to 2018. Due to the nascent state of the renewables sector, the vast majority of investment has come from international development banks and foreign governments. The single largest investor is the European Bank for Reconstruction & Development, responsible for over a cumulative $120 million; and the largest local developer is Newcom Group. If the country is to meet its renewables target, it will need to attract significant investment."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Retail electricity tariffs in Mongolia range from 110.67 tugrik a kWh ($0.04/kWh) for households to 158.23 tugrik a kWh for commercial and industrial users. This level, having climbed by 60% since 2011, puts them higher than neighboring countries such as Kazakhstan, and just slightly cheaper than in China. Wholesale prices for general thermal generators are at 80.86 tugrik/kWh, while the feed-in tariff ranges for on-grid renewables are: wind $80-95/MWh, small hydro $45-60/MWh, and solar $150-180/MWh. This level is generally more attractive than neighboring countries such as Kazakhstan and China. In general, energy costs are higher than in other countries due to transportation and limited know-how in the local market."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Fossil fuels accounted for 95% of generation in 2017, although this may change as the high-polluting Soviet-funded coal plants age, and as renewables investment rises. In addition, grid-connected generating capacity is expanding, which should reduce Mongolia’s significant reliance on electricity imports from Russia in the western grid and to a lesser extent from China in its south. (Mongolia has four grids.) So far, almost 100% dispatch and offtake purchase is secured for wind and solar. In addition, Mongolia has approximately 1MW of off-grid solar and 0.87MW of solar-wind hybrids, which typically apply to soums and gers (Mongolian “towns” and “living tents”) distributed in remote villages. The power market is generally state-owned and the grid is regulated, without near-term plans for liberalization. The state is the biggest player in generation and distribution, and the National Dispatching Center is the only offtaker."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand has slowly increased in recent years but remains low – a trend expected to continue in the coming decade. This is because GDP growth in Mongolia peaked at 17% in 2011 and kept rising at a slower rate since then – it was as low as 1.2% in 2016, then rebounded to 5.9% in 2017. In addition, national electrification is 98%, though access to power is an issue in some rural areas. The country has good land supply and weather conditions to develop wind and solar, while mini- and off-grid systems operate well in remote areas. Last but not least, it needs to modernize its coal-power fleet as it was built at least 30 years ago."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Challenges lie ahead as the country works to clean its power supply. Existing coal-fired plants have low marginal costs to operate, and demand for additional capacity appears stagnant and easily satisfied by a few of the potential projects in the pipeline. Mongolia has no manufacturing capacity for solar or wind components. Imports of such equipment can be exempted from duties and VAT, based on their application and pre-clearance at customs. Foreign and private investment is welcome in the energy sector; but currency instability poses a risk given the tugrik’s history of depreciation. Policy instability, such as the upcoming revision of the renewable energy law and local administrative inefficiency, is also a potential investment barrier. Last but not least, Mongolia has four relatively independent grid regions, which adversely affect the wide dispatch/transmission of renewable energy."}]}
