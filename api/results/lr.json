energy policy","value":"Liberia lacks the policy mechanisms required to achieve the paltry energy targets introduced in 2009. The targets, initially intended for 2015 but later pushed out to 2030, call for 30% of electricity and 10% of overall energy consumption to come from renewable sources, along with a target electrification rate of 35% nationally and 70% in Monrovia. No proven instruments, such as feed-in tariffs or auctions, have been introduced since the target was established. Developers must instead reach a bilateral agreement with the state-owned utility if seeking to supply the main grid. The Rural and Renewable Energy Agency was established in 2015, following a 2010 executive order by then President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. Microgrid operators have since become active across several communities formerly without access to power. A dedicated microgrid policy is currently under development."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The lack of a transparent and uniform policy framework has hindered Liberian clean energy investment. Commercial lenders are yet to enter the market, leaving only concessional agencies to support the limited roll-out of rural electrification projects. Independent renewable power producers are not active, despite policy allowing project operators to sell power to the state-owned utility. However, the country has attracted some foreign private-sector involvement; most notably Manitoba Hydro International, which led the refurbishment of the Mount Coffee Hydropower Plant under tender from the Liberia Electricity Corp. (LEC)."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Liberiaâ€™s retail electricity prices have declined significantly in recent years as a result of the refurbishment of Mount Coffee Hydropower Plant, which brought a low-cost supply to the heavily constrained power system. Regulated tariffs, which are equal across all customer types, dropped by more than 40% over 2015-17, to USD 0.35/kWh today, and further reductions are expected in the next 12 months. Beyond this, a pressing need for substantial investment in the LEC grid may place upward pressure on rates, while the development of renewable energy generators to capture share from diesel generators selling back to LEC may further contain costs."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The power system is served by the LEC, a state-owned monopoly responsible for generation, transmission, distribution, retail supply, and overall system operation. LEC owns and operates a small fleet of mostly hydroelectric generators, the most substantial of which, the 88MW Mount Coffee Hydropower Plant, was refurbished and returned to service in December 2016 after being offline for 26 years through civil turmoil and the Ebola outbreak. LEC also procures power from independent producers â€“ mostly embedded diesel generators. The LEC grid is concentrated around the capital Monrovia, barely reaching the cityâ€™s outer limits. The remainder of the country is not electrified, and it is not served by community-scale microgrid operators either. However, a multinational West Africa Power Pool that passes through Liberia is starting to provide power to some regions in the north of the country."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The refurbishment of the Mount Coffee Hydropower Plant was a game-changer for the Liberian energy system. Power quality and reliability has since improved, and retail rates have dropped. However, demand for electricity far exceeds supply and significant grid issues persist. Customers complain of lengthy wait times for new connections, and power producers have struggled to enter into agreement to supply LEC. Outside of Monrovia, microgrid development has commenced despite the lack of a dedicated policy framework and regulatory oversight. Import duty exemptions on clean energy equipment brought into the country by aid organizations have been exploited by all developers cycling products through eligible agencies."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The lack of clear policy enablers in combination with inaction from the state-owned utility present the most significant barriers to the prosperity of Liberiaâ€™s nascent clean energy industry. Perceived corruption within government is accentuated by long-term vacancies among senior positions in the Ministry of Energy and the utility regulatory commission. Meanwhile, the LEC has earned a reputation of being difficult to negotiate with and tediously slow to interconnect customers and generators. Moving past bureaucratic impediments, the nationâ€™s distinct wet and dry seasons present challenges for planning and operating a system dependent on hydroelectric generation."}]}
