energy policy","value":"Uzbekistan is the most populous country in Central Asia as well the biggest producer of electricity. However, the power sector is highly inefficient, plagued by decades of centralized Soviet-style management. Only recently has the country taken steps to bolster clean energy installations and investment. In 2017, the government published clean energy targets in a strategic plan to reach, saying it aimed to have 1.2GW of hydro, 450MW of PV and 300MW of wind by 2025. However, there has been no clarity on interconnections, tariff regulations or penalties, effectively making this target non-binding and hard to enforce. Nonetheless, the country has signed its first PPA for a 1GW PV project – an indication that large one-off bilateral deals will be the main mechanism for projects to be developed."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy investment has seen a large increase in the past year as the country marked its first major project, a 1GW PV plant developed by SkyPower Global at an approximate cost of $1.3 billion. This is a significant step toward the estimated $6 billion required to achieve the country’s clean energy targets. To date, financing for this project is not complete; however, funds will be raised almost entirely from international private financiers. The government has allocated only $80 million to clean energy investment and expects the remainder to come from foreign sources."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"While electricity prices are low compared to estimated generation costs, those for commercial and industrial sectors are comparable to prices in neighboring countries (around $40/MWh), while residential prices are significantly lower, at $20/MWh. As with most countries in the region, tariffs are indirectly subsidized through low natural gas pricing.  Electricity tariffs have increased steadily at 10-15% annually in recent years, which is roughly the rate of inflation. There are no plans to increase tariffs to better reflect generation costs."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Uzbekistan's energy sector is a legacy of the Soviet era, complete with a centrally owned and operated utility. No part of the energy system is unbundled – generation, distribution and transmission fall under Uzbekenergo or its subsidiaries. Natural gas remains the main energy source in Uzbekistan, followed by coal and large hydro. There is no significant non-hydro renewable capacity. However, the recent announcement for 1GW of PV will increase the share of renewable capacity to nearly 10%. The PPA obligates Uzbekenergo to buy the entirety of the project's production. Outside of this bilaterally negotiated agreement, there is no government regulation that prioritizes renewable dispatch for other projects."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Uzbekistan's power demand is increasing due to a stronger economy and a move toward diversification away from a single resource-based economy. The country is planning to increase capacity for both domestic demand and boost exports to neighboring countries. Uzbekistan hopes to benefit from a more robust unified Central Asian grid, but in the meantime it has moved forward with bilateral agreements with countries such as Afghanistan and Tajikistan."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"There are no explicit policies limiting foreign investment or ownership. Conversely, there are no set rules regulating renewables, interconnection and tariffs. This creates an environment of uncertainty as well as increasing transaction costs as each deal and PPA must be negotiated individually. To date, the single known PPA has provisions for curtailment and offtaker risk as the government is the guarantor for Uzbekenergo. Naturally this mitigates risk but that should be considered along with the fact that Uzbekistan is only now planning to get its first ever credit rating."}]}
