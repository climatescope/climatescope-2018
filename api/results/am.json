energy policy","value":"Armenia aims to make renewables 21% of generation by 2020, and 26% by 2025; and it plans to cap emissions at 633 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent between 2015 and 2050. If hydroelectricity is counted within this renewables fraction, then Armenia has already reached its 2020 goal, as hydro currently makes up 31% of generation. The previous government put in place a generous feed-in tariff for rooftop solar, held an auction for 55MW of large-scale PV, and has issued licenses for commercial scale PV systems. The rules and structure of each of these programs are clear, and have been relatively successful. However, the sudden change in Armenia’s government has resulted in significant uncertainty around the future for these programs."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy investment in Armenia (aside from hydropower) has so far been small, with no large-scale projects currently built. Fotowatio, the winners of the first large-scale PV auction, plan to spend $50 million on the Masrik-1 project, backed by Armenia’s SREP program and the World Bank. Armenia’s energy ministry also provides a Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund to provide concessional financing. Loans for merchant projects have come from the European Development Bank and other international funds. Most investment has focused on solar power, as the country’s wind resources are far from its transmission lines. Additionally, the country has a power deficit in the summer, which matches the supply profile of solar much better than wind."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Armenia’s retail electricity prices are higher than those of its neighbors, but not drastically so. The country is reliant on imported gas for roughly a third of its generation. More so than climate change, energy security is a major driver of the shift to renewable energy. Power prices are not subsidized, but are low enough to be acceptable to most of the population. The cost of renewable energy in Armenia is falling, and becoming more favorable compared to gas. The recent PV auction price of $41.90/MWh was lower than many in the government expected, and will be used as a baseline tariff for other, smaller projects."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Armenia’s electricity capacity is roughly one-third hydro, one- third imported gas, and one-third nuclear. There are some small-scale hydropower plants due to come online, but the major resources are largely tapped. There is appetite for more nuclear power, but the scale of the projects makes them difficult to execute. Even one of the smallest plants that could be built would result in a large excess of power. Renewables are being installed mostly to displace gas and provide more power for the summer peak. The power market is in the process of being liberalized in order to align with EU rules. However, for the moment, Electricity Networks Armenia is the sole buyer and supplier of power for retail and industrial consumers. The generation market is fully liberalized, with a range of owners and smaller players. Liberalization, which has been legislated and is due to come into force this year, will mean that large energy consumers can choose to buy electricity directly from generators, although for the moment there is little demand for corporate PPAs."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Armenia’s peak demand has been falling slightly from a high of 1.5GWp in 2013. The country’s economy has been relatively stable throughout the period, but there has been an increase in energy efficiency efforts and regulation. In a country whose main industry is construction, these regulations could have a marked effect on power demand. The country is 100% electrified, with little need for off-grid capacity. Resources for solar and wind are good, though transmission constraints have prevented much investment in wind. There are plans to modernize the hydropower fleet in order to extend the lifetimes of the plants."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Armenia has taken steps to build a domestic supply chain for PV equipment and services. The government has granted licenses for small systems (0.5–1MW) to encourage local providers to develop expertise. Licenses will be increased to 5MW in the next few years, to prepare them to participate in future auction rounds. There are currently no special duties on renewable equipment, and no local content requirements. The process for building and connecting renewable energy has been fairly straightforward, and the ministry has been offering supply agreements of 15-20 years. However, there is significant political risk in the country, as the government was very suddenly replaced in May 2018. There is currently little clarity on which energy policies the new administration will elect to keep, though most had broad support when they were introduced."}]}
