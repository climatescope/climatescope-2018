energy policy","value":"Kyrgyzstan generates less than 2% of its power generation from renewable energy sources other than large hydro, but the country aims to increase this figure to 10% by 2021. The main policy in place to reach this target is the country’s “Forty Steps to a New Era” program, which calls for the construction of 11 new small hydro power plants (with a capacity of about 160MW) over the coming three years. Small hydro plants are able to take advantage of a feed-in tariff offered by the Energy Regulator and are exempt from most VAT and customs duties. The country only has about 80MW of small hydro installed now, but its utilization of clean energy is significant. Large hydro accounts for the vast majority (nearly 80%) of Kyrgyzstan’s installed power capacity."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Kyrgyzstan has not seen substantial investment in clean energy. Though the government has called for the construction of a fleet of new small hydro plants, the country’s installed small hydro capacity has remained flat in recent years and the deployment of other renewables, such as wind and solar, has been negligible to date. Still, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank are active in Kyrgyzstan, and these groups have provided grants to support various governmental clean energy and energy efficiency initiatives."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Kyrgyzstan, like many of its neighbors in the former Soviet Union, has low power prices due to government subsidies. While electricity rates have increased slightly in recent years, prices for residential customers remain some of the lowest in the world (at just $0.01/kWh) and far below the level needed for full cost recovery. Still, electricity rates will have to increase further still if the government is to tackle the main issues facing the power sector: out-of-date infrastructure and weak reliability of supply."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Kyrgyzstan does not have a competitive wholesale market. While the country’s vertically integrated state-owned utility, Kyrgyzenergo, was formally unbundled in 2001, state-controlled entities continue to dominate its power sector. Electric Power Plants JSC, for example, controls nearly 98% of power generation, the National Electric Energy Transmitting Co. has a monopoly in power transmission and four companies (that is, Vostokelectro, Jalalabatelectro, Oshelectro and Severelectro) handle nearly all power distribution. Kyrgyzstan’s installed power capacity has remained flat in recent years at around 3.8GW, but the country needs more capacity. Renewables besides large hydro play only a nominal role in the country’s power sector."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Its electrification rate is near 100%, but Kyrgyzstan suffers from power supply reliability issues due to its dependence on large hydropower plants, most of which are operating beyond their intended lifespan. While peak power demand has remained flat in recent years, the country needs to install additional power capacity and invest in existing plants in order to address these reliability concerns and enable economic growth. Kyrgyzstan has seen GDP of around 4% for the past five years. It is likely this figure would be higher if power outages were less frequent."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"There are numerous barriers to renewable energy development in Kyrgyzstan, and organic market growth remains unlikely. While the government has introduced some support mechanisms for small hydro, policy support for wind and solar is nonexistent. The industry is too nascent for foreign developers to enter the market and there are a number of barriers to doing business in Kyrgyzstan, such as unclear land allocation regulations, inconsistent legal frameworks, insufficient local expertise and weak enforceability of commercial contracts. International development banks are working to tackle some of these market challenges."}]}
