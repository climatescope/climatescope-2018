energy policy","value":"Pakistan has seen a rapid expansion of renewable energy since 2015, with some projects built under the bilateral China-Pakistan-Economic-Corridor (CPEC) initiative which is driving Chinese funding to infrastructure projects in Pakistan. The new government led by Prime Minister Imran Khan seems to be committed to the CPEC, and to clean energy, but its preferences and priorities are yet to be spelled out. The previous government had already decided on moving to an auctions-based regime instead of relying on feed-in tariffs, and was mulling an increase in the clean energy target to 20% of total commercial energy by 2030, from 5%."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The total installed capacity of solar, wind and biomass is set to cross 2,000MW by the end of 2018. Rooftop PV installations have picked up pace, as they are a means to avoid frequent power shutdowns, and also save on electricity costs. There are new high wind zones waiting to be developed. Overseas investors active in Pakistan's clean energy sector include Three Gorges from China and Zorlu Enerji from Turkey.  The multilateral development banks are also active in pushing energy access, as well as in promoting initiatives like smart metering. Most projects rely on some form of concessional financing."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Power prices have been artificially kept low, increasing the problem of circular debt. With the country seeking a bailout package from the International Monetary Fund, there will be increasing pressure to align retail tariffs with costs. Thermal power plants dominate electricity generation in Pakistan (oil -7GW, gas – 9GW), while solar and wind plants total almost 2GW. There are some new coal and gas plants under construction under the CPEC. The list of 21 energy projects under the corridor include less efficient sub-critical coal-fired power stations as well as lignite plants. One of the first statements made by the newly appointed advisor on climate change – Malik Amin Aslam – was that the new government would ensure the \"strictest possible environment controls\" on these projects for which contracts are already sealed and signed."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Pakistan's renewable energy sector has been dominated by wind so far, but the solar sector has also picked up pace now. The power sector however has an albatross around its neck – a 'circular debt' burden of over a trillion rupees ($8 billion). Power distribution companies are stressed as the regulator allows them to claim only a part of their transmission and distribution losses from the consumer. The regulator also assumes 100% collection efficiency, which is not the case in actuality. This revenue gap of the distribution companies hits the generators and also the consumers. Tackling this burden would be one of the first tasks of the new government. While the power generation sector is open to competition, the transmission and distribution sector is largely controlled by government-owned entities. Some cities like Karachi have a private sector distribution company (K-Electric)."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"A spate of new power plants commissioned in the last few years means that the gap between demand and supply has narrowed, and planners are getting ready for an era of surplus electricity. This is despite the fact that about a fourth of the population does not have access to electricity. A surplus of about 900MW at peak time was expected in the year ended June 30, 2018, according to the regulator (Nepra).  This would increase to almost 14GW by 2025. This puts brakes on the expansion of renewables, even though they present the most cost-competitive option to generate power."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The new government campaigned on an anti-corruption agenda. Initial statements from Prime Minister Khan underline the need to break from the past, within limits, which indicates that a pragmatic approach will be followed. Nevertheless, the country is in a volatile region (with Iran and Afghanistan as neighbors) with a currency that has lost significant value since the beginning of the year.  There have been at least three devaluations in the last nine months. There is uncertainty about another IMF bailout. Taking on more debt from China would come with its own share of risks."}]}
