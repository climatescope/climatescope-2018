energy policy","value":"Malawi has limited clean energy policies. In 2017, state-owned utility Escom held its first renewable energy tender, contracting 70MW of PV power across four sites. To attract foreign investment in the power sector, the country has started opening up the electricity market with a standardized PPA to allow independent power producers to operate. The country does have a rural electrification fund incentive, tax incentives and a feed-in tariff policy for small-scale projects; however, progress is slow. Several IPPs are developing projects and more than 36 memoranda of understanding have been signed so far, the majority on renewable energy projects. However, as of now, only one IPP is in line to agree PPAs by the end of 2018. Clean energy project developers and manufacturers can qualify for general tax incentives that were set up to support foreign investment."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Most financing to date has come from internal investment, through Malawi's Ministry of Natural Resources, Energy and Mining (MNREM); however, some has come from IPPs based in other countries. The planned 300MW Kammwamba coal-fired power plant has met all the 14 conditions that were set by the financiers AXIM Bank of China for Malawi to access the loan for the project."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Average commercial and industrial electricity prices fell in 2017 after a large rise in the preceding year, with residential tariffs increasing 6%. With coal being cheaper than diesel, electricity prices are expected to fall as the three new coal-fired plants currently in the planning phase come online by 2021. Malawi is not connected to power systems with neighboring countries and cannot therefore benefit from membership of the Southern African and the East African Power Pools.  A plan to interconnect with Mozambique and Zambia for the purchase of at least 150MW is being developed."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Malawi’s electricity generation relies predominantly on large hydro, which accounts for 87% of the total installed capacity. Recently increased electricity demand has been met with supply from oil and diesel generators. In 2017, Escom held its first renewable energy tender, contracting 70MW of PV power. In 2018, IPPs issued tenders for 40MW of solar, but nothing has come to fruition yet. Malawian President Peter Mutharika has been in discussions with a Chinese consortium to construct a 300MW coal-fired power plant. In August 2016, the government completed the unbundling of the power sector. Escom became responsible for transmission, distribution and retail, while the new company; Electricity Supply Corporation of Malawi (Egenco) became in charge of generation."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Malawi's electrification rate in 2017 is 10-11%, according to the Department of Energy Affairs and World. The country plans to more than double power supply by 2023 to end chronic blackouts. Currently, Malawi has 395MW of installed capacity, but President Peter Mutharika aims to raise it to 720MW in two years and to at least 1GW by 2023, as well as stating that the country needs not less than 2GW. The nation is going to expand its hydroelectric system with new dams and will diversify sources to include coal, wind, solar and gas. There are plans to complete the 300MW Kam’mwamba coal-fired facility by 2021, with a further two coal projects in the pipeline totalling 800MW."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"In Malawi there is an absence of stable and convincing renewables incentives, besides tax deductions and import duty exemptions on generation equipment. The country lacks experience with renewables project development and most recent talks seem to show the governments interest in coal power. There are no obvious PPA duration limitations on the PPA market. Clause 2.2 of the standard PPA does not specify the duration of the agreement, but instead leaves it to the seller and the off-taker to decide on an agreement. When it comes to interconnection, a \"\"grid code\"\" has been approved with rules on the process and standards for connecting to the grid. Malawi has signed a PPA with Zambia for 20MW, however it is yet to become active. There are currently no interconnections, but talks are ongoing with Zambia and Mozambique."}]}
