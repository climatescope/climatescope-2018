energy policy","value":"Indonesia aims to generate 23% of primary energy consumption from renewables by 2025, up from around 5% in 2017. This target may be too bold, given the recent low levels of finance committed to renewables. The Electricity Supply Plan (RUPTL) 2018 sets goals to add 8.3GW of hydro, 4.6GW of geothermal and 2GW of other renewables over 2018-27. New solar and wind projects are to be awarded through a limited tender process. Bid prices are restricted to 85% of the regional generation cost, if it exceeds the national average. If the regional cost is less than the national average, tariffs can be negotiated between PLN and the developer. This policy, known as ‘Regulation number 50’, has provoked industry complaints that it incentivizes project development in remote areas with high regional generation tariffs but low electricity demand. Additionally, the process to participate in the tender is not clear and there is little clarity on the PPA template."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Indonesia has seen very limited investment in solar and wind power, with geothermal accounting for around 90% of the $800 million raised in 2017. Its first large-scale PV plant in 2018 secured financing from the Asian Development Bank, which will invest $40 million in the 42MW of PV plants under development by Vena Energy across four locations. There is interest from commercial banks to participate in the renewables market but their involvement has been limited due to lack of investment-grade projects."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Power prices in Indonesia are one of the lowest in the region: at $0.08-0.09/kWh for commercial and industrial users in 2017, and $0.08/kWh for households. Government subsidizes retail electricity tariffs, which are 20-30% lower than the cost of supply including generation, transmission and distribution. Subsidy is given directly to PLN, the national utility of Indonesia, to cover its electricity supply cost. In 2018, the government said that it would not change the prices until 2019. The levelized cost of solar and wind power are higher than retail tariffs, and have not declined at the same rate as other Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand due to poor capacity development."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The power market in Indonesia is semi-unbundled: private players may only participate in generation, and accounted for 25% of the installed capacity in 2017. System operation, transmission and distribution is controlled by PLN, which is the sole offtaker. Private developers are not allowed to sign direct PPAs with consumers. Corporate users may only procure renewable power through on-site PV systems. Indonesia’s power mix is dominated by fossil fuels, which accounted for 87% of the installed capacity in 2017. The share of coal has increased from 36% to 49% of the installed capacity over 2010-17 to meet the rapid rise in electricity demand. Renewables’ share has declined due to lack of support from government."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand in Indonesia is not increasing as expected by the country’s policy planners. Economic growth rates were high during 2010-12, and electricity demand increased at an annual rate of 8-9%. Demand growth has slowed since 2014 to only 4-5% per year due to lower-than-expected GDP growth. This has forced the government to cut its power capacity expansion plans. The electrification rate has increased to 92% in 2017 from only 64% in 2010 There is a huge potential to develop clean energy microgrids in Indonesia as the country has more than a gigawatt of diesel power generators providing electricity in the remote regions. Replacing diesel power with a combination of solar, battery storage and diesel could decrease generation costs as well as emissions."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Indonesia has a history of implementing strict rules on local content in the power sector. In 2017, solar companies were required to use at least 43% local content in goods and services used in the plant. Project development costs are also higher than in neighboring markets due to inconsistent tax incentives and high property prices that reduce the chances of renewable developers undercutting the costs of existing generation. In addition, the Indonesian rupiah has seen high volatility against the U.S. dollar, which is a concern for foreign players if the project revenue or costs are in local currency. The need to engage with multiple government agencies at local and national level is another hurdle for project developers. Dependence of PLN, which offtakes power from all the grid-connected power plants, on government subsidies to stay afloat has resulted in higher off-taker credit risk."}]}
