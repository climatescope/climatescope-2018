energy policy","value":"The government targets around 100MW of new renewables over the 2015-30 period. The most tangible signs of progress have been the commissioning of a 20MW PV project in 2Q 2018 owned by the state-owned utility, Jirama, and the tender for 25MW of solar with storage supported by the World Bank's Scaling Solar program. However, the countryâ€™s grid and generation fleet is in urgent need of investment and it would not be surprising if the 50MW gap left to meet the 2030 target once the current pipeline is delivered was exceeded rapidly and the goals revised upwards."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy asset finance for utility-scale projects to date has been limited to the self-funded 20MW project owned by Jirama for a value estimated at around $12 million. The other project in the pipeline is contracted through the Scaling Solar program and should be able to secure financing as a result of the guarantees and incentives provided to the winning developers."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"The government purchases the fuel for diesel generation in bulk and finances a budget gap at the main utility which is required to retail electricity below its extremely high costs. However, current power procurement costs are well above those of renewables technologies. The government is aware that renewables offer a good solution for reducing the cost of producing electricity in Madagascar and should continue to create opportunities for project developers as a result."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The sector has been opened up to IPPs for over a decade and there is a clear intention to attract more private and international investment into that segment. The retail of electricity can also be done by independent companies through direct sales or within rural electrification concessions; however experience in this segment remains limited. The typical PPA guarantees a volume and number of run hours to the generator for up to 20 years. Madagascar still lacks a modern dispatch center but a project led by the World Bank is looking to address this in the coming years."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Jirama, which is the sole offtaker on the main grid, is under considerable financial stress and generators have started to be paid in treasury bonds, highlighting the high level of off-taker risk on the island. The budget gap covered by the government to support social retail tariffs and high fuel-import bills doubled from 2009 to 2014 to reach $150 million despite lower energy commodity prices at the time. The growth of renewables in the mix will improve the financial health of the utility and is government priority as a result. The 80% of the population that remains without access to electricity in Madagascar also presents an enormous opportunity for developers to get stuck in and deliver off-grid projects."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Administrative process and land acquisition can be difficult and lengthy. Access to finance is generally complicated. The state of the grid will also causes stability issues for larger projects. This is why international technical assistance in the country has recommended that most PV developers include a battery in their project (as in the 2018 Scaling Solar tender) and finance their connection to the grid."}]}
