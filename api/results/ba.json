energy policy","value":"The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) has implemented a number of renewable energy incentives. First and foremost among which is a target for the share of clean technologies in gross final energy consumption set through its National Renewable Energy Action Plan submitted to the European Commission. The country aims to reach 40% by 2020, a target which has already been surpassed by several percentage points due to large hydro’s classification as renewable. A feed-in tariff exists for several renewable technologies, including wind, solar geothermal, hydro and biomass, with an average tariff duration of 12 years. The government also encourages self-generation by offering power producers the right to a premium for the generation of electricity for their own use."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The country’s maiden wind farm – the 50.6MW Mesihovina project – began producing electricity in March 2018. The facility was built at a cost of $101.4 million. While Siemens provided the turbines, the project was primarily financed through a loan provided by KfW, a German state-owned development bank. Meanwhile, the BiH government has launched a tender for the construction of a 65MW solar project. Most renewables investment has come from international concessional lenders, including the International Finance Corporation, European Investment Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. In addition to domestic funds and government grants, organizations such as the United Nations Development Program, GIZ and USAID provide co-financing as well as technical assistance."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Comparable to those found in Macedonia, power prices are lower than in Albania and Croatia, but higher than in Serbia. Residential tariffs are too low to encourage the private sector to invest in building many new power plants. This state of affairs has contributed to the country being four times as energy intensive as the EU average. The highly subsidized residential sector amounts to more than half of final energy consumption. Tariffs have, however, been increasing incrementally in recent years."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"BiH’s power fleet is roughly split between just over 2.1GW of capacity from five lignite power plants and an equal amount of hydro. As mentioned above, the aforementioned 50.6MW Mesihovina wind farm started operating in March 2018. Renewable energy capacity is minimal, but includes wind, solar, biomass and small hydro. Several further wind farms are planned, including two of 48MW each, in addition to six lignite power plants. While the electricity sector is open to private participation, the overwhelming share of generation and distribution is overseen by three vertically integrated, public utilities whose remit is geographically distributed. The transmission system is owned by a state-owned transco, Elektroprenos BiH and wholesale trading is policed by a comprehensive regulatory framework."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The World Bank estimates that BiH’s energy sector is in need of an additional $6 billion for the modernization of its power sector and construction of new generation facilities. Over half of the country’s thermal capacity was commissioned in the 1960s and 1970s – the list of thermal power plants to be closed encompasses 30% of the country’s total thermal capacity. Demand has grown strongly since the turn of the millennium, and power generation increased by 50% between 2001 and 2013. As exports more than quadrupled between 2001 and 2010, distribution losses halved in the 2007-10 period. Although BiH is currently a net electricity exporter, this could change if no significant generation facilities are brought into service over the next decade."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The country’s highly decentralized institutions and fragmented governance structure have long hampered the liberalization of the national electricity sector. Within southeastern Europe, BiH is consistently ranked as the worst performer in reforming its power market. A lack of communication among different government departments and tortuous licensing procedures complicate project development. Matters are worsened by the lack of awareness regarding renewable energy throughout the general population, reducing the political pressure to promote its deployment. In addition, the three public utilities are self-sustaining, but recent years have seen the deterioration of their financial results due to poor hydraulic conditions and ageing thermal assets. Curtailment is not an issue given the low level of variable renewables deployment to date."}]}
