energy policy","value":"Algeria has the ambitious goal to add 22GW of renewables generation capacity by 2030, with the aim of saving 300 billion m3 of its gas reserves as a result. The targets are broken down by sector and include a first goal of 4.5GW by 2020 that the country is unlikely to meet. The main issue around Algeria’s renewables target lays in the government’s high upfront local content expectations which the nascent domestic sector is not yet ready to fulfil, and the uncertainties around the financial guarantees for developers. Algeria’s announcement of a first tender for 4GW of renewables, which would have allowed it to meet its 2020 objectives in one go, was stymied by the fact that it is not willing to back down on these local content expectations the domestic industry is not yet ready to fulfil."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Renewable energy projects to date have been small at around 15-20MW, with the biggest being Sonelgaz's Sahara portfolio of 14 plants totalling 268MW. The country attracted $557 million of clean energy investment over 2006-17 but saw no big deals in the last three years. Despite its abundant solar potential, obstacles to investment include the level of bureaucracy, evolving regulatory framework and a weak financial sector. Stringent local content rules, if left unchanged, are likely to impact the cost of projects for developers by raising the cost of equipment and of finance, at least in the short term. In the short term, the government is also faced with the issue of having spent several billions of dollars in adding new gas capacity to the grid and upgrading existing power plants. This has resulted in a cooling of renewables ambitions as demand has been growing at a lower-than-anticipated rate."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Clean energy projects developed so far have benefited from feed-in tariffs, Algeria’s primary renewables support mechanism to date. The feed-in tariff is awarded for 20 years for wind and solar, and 15 years for cogeneration. The rate will change after the first five years of operation and will only be paid for a limited number of hours a year, after which electricity will be sold at conventional prices. Conventional prices are predominantly set by the cost of producing domestic gas and are relatively low as a result, especially considering the relative competiveness of renewables is hurt by stringent local content requirements."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Algeria opened up the electricity sector to competition in the generation segment in 2002. To date, however, the sector remains dominated by Sonelgaz whose competitive position allowed by its access to cheap domestic gas resources is hard to challenge. The country’s delayed renewables auctions will most likely change this landscape rapidly. The Sonelgaz group is also the sole authorized retailer of electricity on the country’s three grids. However, consumers are free to procure their own electricity through self-generation or direct PPAs. The recent drop in the cost of solar, the costs and difficult operating conditions for diesel generators, as well as issues around the quality and availability of grid electricity supply have created a growing market for small-scale renewables."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Economic activity in Algeria is known to be stymied by excessive red tape and administrative process that can be costly in time. This holds also true in the energy sector, although the extensive set of regulation also provides developers a firm legal basis on which to build their projects. Sonelgaz is the offtaker for Algeria's grid. The company's financials have been extremely strained in recent years and it is suffering from losses, fraud and inefficiencies. However, it is a public company and the government or public banks have supported it financially."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The main challenges for developers are local content requirements and restrictions on the use of foreign financing sources which are not compensated by domestic alternatives. The government has also refused to offer developers a sovereign guarantee which creates concern for financiers as there are expectations that the offtaker, Sonelgaz, will be restructured in the near future. Some project developers for commercial and industrial users have, however, started to secure funding for their activities domestic commercial banks."}]}
