energy policy","value":"Azerbaijan set a target in 2011 for renewables to account for 20% of electricity generation by 2020. More recently, in December 2016, the country’s Strategic Roadmap for Public Utilities, which calls for the installation of 4.2GW of renewables, was endorsed by President Ilham Aliyev. This plan includes an estimated 3.5GW of wind, 500MW of PV and 200MW of biomass – however, there has been no significant movement toward these goals. A constant reshuffling of government agencies and the lack of a framework for PPAs and interconnections have deterred investors. There has been some show of political will, especially by the State Agency of Alternative and Renewable Energy Sources, to encourage clean energy growth."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"There has been very limited investment in clean energy so far, with only 123MW of installed capacity. This will obviously need to ramp up very quickly if the country is to meet its 2020 target of 4.2GW of renewables. There is no domestic financing option, with only international development banks active in the sector."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"The power sector in Azerbaijan is centrally controlled by the state-owned utility, AzerEnerji. It controls all aspects of the supply chain from generation to distribution."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Power tariffs are set by the so-called Tariff Council, which determines all public prices in the country from bus fares to electricity. At times there is a disconnect between those pushing for technology-specific tariffs and the Tariff Council, the main goal of which is controlling inflation through price control. Recently there has been some clarification for renewables in a study that determined the wholesale tariff of $0.033/kWh would be profitable for renewable projects. Electricity prices in Azerbaijan are low compared to global levels but high for the region and as a percentage of income. Power prices are $0.052/kWh for commercial and $0.041-0.064/kWh for residential."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"One barrier to meeting demand is the inefficiency of the country’s grid and a dependence on regional cooperation regarding the Central Asian power grid. Electrification in the country is near 100% and it has already undergone a power fleet modernization. There is no framework for off-grid or rooftop solar, however, the Ministry of Energy has identified off-grid as a strategic sector."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"As is the case for many countries in the region, Azerbaijan's economy, budget and credit rating rely greatly on the price of oil and gas. In periods of lower oil prices, the country has slashed investment in other industries and subsidized hydrocarbon use to promote the sector. This adds another level of complexity to project finance as the government is a guarantor to many projects. Over the last decade, the government has shuffled agencies and changed their mandates, leaving no clear authority to enact policies for renewables.  Nonetheless, Azerbaijan has a positive reputation for supporting foreign investment in the energy sector."}]}
