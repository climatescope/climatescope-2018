energy policy","value":"Two major laws, the Electric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA) and Renewable Energy Act (RE), have incentivized growth in the Philippines’ renewable sector. However, implementation of those laws has been slow, and as a result their energy targets were missed. There has been staggered renewables build, and the country plans to hit 15.3GW of renewables capacity by 2030 and total generating capacity of about 65GW by 2040. A feed-in tariff (FiT) has spurred 1.052GW of renewables growth, and behind-the-meter policies have achieved an impressive 50MW of distributed resources. The recent implementation of a renewables portfolio standard (RPS) is another positive sign, but the policies together haven’t been sufficient to reach the national targets."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The Philippines has seen scattered renewables investment. Geothermal and hydro initially made up most of the build, but spiking demand caused the government to lean toward conventional power. The EPIRA officially opened up generation to the private industry in 2001. Since then the generation sector has been dominated by thee major players. The country has had difficulty financing renewables due to challenging policy and infrastructure conditions. The government allows no more than 40% foreign ownership in projects. For developers, challenges such as becoming a Qualified Third Party (QTP) or Independent Power Producer (IPP) and bottlenecks in permitting make it difficult to secure financing for projects. The FiT, which is paid on the basis of actual production, ultimately was a losing proposition for many investors. Developers raced to commission projects, but to date about 360MW of commissioned solar intended to receive the FiT missed the cut to claim its benefits."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Electricity in the Philippines is among the most expensive in Southeast Asia. While costs are decreasing, they are doing so at a slower rate than their neighbors. A lot of this is due to geography. The country is far from the sources of its imported fuels, and power prices reflect that. Economies of scale are hindered because the Philippine is made up of more than 7,000 islands.  Adding to this are ratepayer subsidies and spending on off-grid and grid-extension projects, which bumps up unsubsidized rates."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Before the 1980s, geothermal, oil/diesel and hydropower generation were the biggest share of installed capacity, but coal eclipsed those resources as demand burgeoned. Coal was the largest power source, at 47GWh (52%) in 2017, with the renewables share dwindling to 19% of generation. After the 2001 liberalization of the generation market under the EPIRA, Aboitiz Power, San Miguel Global Power and Trans Asia acquired the majority of assets. They currently own about 62% of all power generation assets in the Philippines. The Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) was also institutionalized at this time for Luzon and Visayas regions and will soon be open to Mindanao. The government has also opened more options for developers to sign power supply agreements (PSAs) directly with customers with a large enough demand. It also mandated utilities to facilitate retail opportunities for customers wanting renewable power through a Green Energy Option program. With a large increase in forecast demand there is potential for renewables to grab part of the pie. However, the Philippines is targeting coal to increase generation the most, up to five times the current level."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Over the past two decades, the Philippines went through significant energy reform, including opening the power industry to the private sector. However, the relationship between developer and regulators has been strained, with developers complaining about red tape and bureaucracy. While the government has created policies that allow more private participation, the failure to meet installation targets suggests a lack of follow-through. Unpermitted rooftop solar is widespread. One of the largest solar vendors widely advertises a solar/diesel/storage microgrid that is often deployed without the required permits. While policy implementation lags, both population and economic growth are expected to increase demand greatly and open more opportunity for power development."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The current FiT program for solar and wind has reached capacity and won’t be expanded. The project permitting process may involve dozens of agencies, causing some developers to wait over five years for approval. Utilities have limited the technologies they will contract for. Legal obstacles have made it difficult to provide renewable power for behind the meter projects and areas with limited power. All of this hinders setting up renewable microgrids and net metering and entering into PSAs. Limitations on foreign ownership, a lack of transmission capacity and the Philippines’ archipelago geography create additional challenges to developing a project. Other initiatives offer the hope that some of these barriers will be addressed. The Green Energy Option program will require utilities to facilitate renewable PPAs to give deliver renewable power to end-users. The RPS will also push utilities to increase their sourced share of clean power and set up a market to trade renewable energy credits."}]}
