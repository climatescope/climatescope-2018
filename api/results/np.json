energy policy","value":"The government of Nepal has a long-term target for hydro – 10GW by 2020 and 25GW by 2030 – and for electricity from renewables to account for 80% of generation by 2050. Its National Rural and Renewable Energy Program, initiated in 2012, targeted 25MW mini and micro hydro, 600,000 solar home systems, along with goals for biogas, water pumps, solar cookers, and also aimed to reduce dependency on fossil fuels by 50%, and cut CO2 emissions by 14 million metric tons by 2020. The targets are very ambitious as the country only has about 1GW of hydro. There is a feed-in tariff but this is rarely adjusted and is not cost reflective. Lots of plans have been put in place to achieve these targets, but progress has been slow."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Various funds have been set up by the government for the development of renewables, such as the Central Renewable Energy Fund and the Small Hydro Power Fund. However, the government is also aware that it will be unable to make sufficient investments on its own. Focus is on increasing foreign investments and drawing private players into the market. International donors such as World Bank, Asian Development Bank and UNDB have financed projects in the past, and policies and subsidies have been introduced to promote foreign direct investments as well. The country has the potential to attract more than 28 trillion Nepalese rupees ($268 billion) in foreign capital into energy sector by 2045 if it recognizes foreign direct investment as a top priority and implements policies and incentives to promote FDI, as quoted in Nepal’s 2017 Investment Summit."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Nepal's electricity tariffs are relatively low compared to the neighboring countries. One of the reasons for heavy losses incurred by the Nepal Electricity Authority is the absence of a tariff adjustment system. Tariffs were last adjusted in 2016 after a period of 12 years. The Electricity Tariff Fixation Commission increased prices by 19% and replaced the provision of minimum charges with a fixed service charge. ADB conducted a policy dialogue with the NEA which highlighted the need for tariff revisions on a regular basis."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The NEA enjoys monopoly control over the power market; however, increasing the role of private sector is one of the major goals of the government. Several PPAs have been signed between IPPs and Nepal Electricity Authority to privatize the sector. Solid biofuels used in the residential sector account for about 80% of total energy consumption in the country. Roughly about 23% of electricity is imported and the rest is generated by hydro plants.  Nepal has immense potential for hydropower and that continues to be the focus in all energy policy. Ambitious targets have been set for hydro, with small contributions expected from the wind and solar sectors as well. In 2017, Nepal increased its electricity imports, mainly from India. Power imports cost 15 billion Nepalese rupees in the last fiscal year."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand is growing at about 8% per year, and is expected to exceed 17,400GWh by 2027. The increased demand is largely to be met by additional hydropower resources. Only 1.7% of the total estimated 42GW of hydro resources is tapped. The current growth in hydropower implies the country’s targets will probably not be met. The electrification rate currently stands at 85%, after huge jumps made both for rural and urban areas from 2010. The target is to achieve 100% electrification by 2030."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Nepal aims to increase foreign investments in the energy sector. Currently, the country has not been able to attract much of such investments mainly because of the high risks related to the offtaker, curtailment and foreign exchange, as well as inadequate infrastructure and cumbersome government procedures within the energy sector. Projects under construction are often put on hold because of natural disasters in the country. Products must be approved by the AEPC's Renewable Energy Test Station to qualify for subsidies and a VAT exemption – but market participants view this as helpful for upholding quality standards. All these factors create an unfavorable environment for attracting capital for energy projects."}]}
