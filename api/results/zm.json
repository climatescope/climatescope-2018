energy policy","value":"Zambia's 2008 National Energy Policy, in line with the 2030 vision of universal electrification, aims to address the barriers associated with the wide deployment of renewable energy technology. In mid-2016, Zambia’s scaling solar programme attracted two bids totalling 81MW which yielded arguably the lowest solar prices in sub-Saharan Africa. Construction on the 34 MW grid-connected Ngonye solar PV project has begun and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2019. The country’s electrification target is ambitious but appears achievable with the recently successful launch of the Request for Proposal (RfP) for the 100MW solar PV tender and announcement of the 100MW small hydro tender as part of the GET FiT program. Along with the planned dissemination of 500,000 solar home systems and installation of 350,000 solar water heaters, Zambia appears to be taking positive steps towards increasing access to modern energy services and meeting the ever growing energy demand of Zambia. State-owned utility Zesco are currently facing financial strain and plan on implementing an approved cost-reflective tariff increase of 75% by the end of 2018. All policies have been stable and made fairly transparent."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The 2015/16 drought had a devastating effect on the Zambian economy bringing annual GDP growth downwards from a mean 7%, between 2002 and 2014, to 2.92% in 2015, the lowest since 1998. With the resulting rise in electricity demand, Zambia’s investment into clean energy has shown positive and stable growth in recent years. The country remains highly dependent on hydro generation, which accounts for approximately 99% of renewables and 85% of overall generation. Despite solar having a minimal impact in the past, high solar irradiation values and declining technology costs promise strong potential for the development of PV-based generation, demonstrated by the IFC’s Scaling Solar program and SIDA’s Beyond the Grid Fund.  Wind energy potential in Zambia is relatively limited and is not particularly suitable for electricity generation.  Despite poor support from local debt providers, the country has received both international concessional and commercial support with the largest from the Export-Import Bank of China ($130 million)."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Up until recently, electricity prices have remained fairly stable due to being heavily subsidized by government. In 2017, however, average commercial electricity prices increased significantly as Zesco began implementing steps toward more cost-reflective tariffs. The expected 75% tariff increase, under the Energy Regulatory Board's proposal, is mainly due to a sharp shortage of up to 600MW of electricity from poor rainfall in 2015/16. This has put pressure on government to raise cash that will be used to increase investment into other energy sources and boost power supply."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Zesco is a vertically integrated electricity utility owned by the Zambian government that generates, transmits, distributes and supplies the majority of the country's electricity. Its reliance on hydro generation is not forecasted to change as Zambia’s hydro generation potential is estimated at more than 6,000MW. Several existing large hydro facilities are currently being upgraded by Zesco, while a substantial pipeline of projects, including the 2,400MW Batoka Gorge Dam power project and the 850–1,200 MW Luapula hydro scheme are in the planning phase. A large and untapped potential remains for small-scale hydropower, especially for rural electrification. Despite there being zero commissioned PV plants to date, the continual decline in technology costs have aided the potential for PV expansion as seen by projects such as the IFC’s Scaling Solar program.  Wind energy potential in Zambia is relatively limited as is not particularly suitable for electricity generation."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Zambia’s electrification rate is 67% in urban areas and 4% in rural areas, giving the country an overall national electrification of approximately 31%. The government’s plan of universal access by 2030 is likely to mean favourable policies will be introduced for mini-grids or off-grid solar, evident from the successful launch of the small-scale solar tender program currently under way. Demand for electricity has been rising due to robust GDP growth of more than 6% per year for the past decade, particularly in the mining, manufacturing and agriculture sectors. According to the Zambia Development Agency (ZDA), the demand for electricity in the country has been growing at an average of about 3%, or between 150 and 200 MW, each year. Despite the drop in copper prices in 2016, international agencies have given Zambia's mining sector a positive outlook as copper production nearly doubled in light of the introduction of Zambia’s first coal-fired power plant, Maamba power plant, in July 2016. This will further add to the increasing demand for power. Most Zambian power plants are hydro stations that do not require short-term upgrades."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Zambia, along with most other Sub-Saharan countries, has an import duty exemption on all renewable energy type equipment and machinery for agriculture, aquaculture and mining. Zesco currently controls all generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in Zambia, but its financial position is not considered stable and it receives a sizeable amount of funding from government. The joint IDA and IFC Scaling Solar project aims to address Zambia’s current power shortages by increasing the reliability and security of electricity supplies.  Their presence has a significant leveraging impact and de-risks projects through off-taker risk cover, helping the country attract investors and lenders, and lower project tariffs. Power Africa has been working with African governments and private sector partners to remove barriers that impede sustainable energy development."}]}
