energy policy","value":"Turkey has ambitious capacity targets across renewables sectors, aiming to reach 20GW of wind energy, 5GW of solar and 1GW of geothermal by 2023, as well 34GW of hydro. A boom in unlicensed solar development saw Turkey approach 4.6GW by mid-2018 and the 1GW geothermal target was reached in 2017, thanks to a generous feed-in tariff. While wind growth has been steady, the 20GW would require the installation of more than 2GW a year of additional capacity, and policy support has been inconsistent. The site-specific 1GW YEKA auctions got off to a rocky start as the winners of the 2017 rounds have not reached financial close. The feed-in tariff is also due to expire after 2020, with no visibility on support for renewables after that point."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Investment in clean energy grew steadily in Turkey over 2012-17, with wind dominating the totals and accounting for more than $1 billion each year over that period. Solar saw a surge in investment in 2017 as unlicensed projects rushed to commissioning before transmission costs increased. However, investment in clean energy has stagnated in 2018, amid policy uncertainty and ongoing political uncertainty and currency fluctuations. Turkey holds auctions for pre-licenses, which are required for renewables projects to reach commissioning, and after two auctions held in 2017 no more have been announced for either wind or solar, leaving developers with no route to bring projects online."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Power prices in Turkey have risen over the last five years, but are still kept low through intervention in the market. Wholesale power prices do not allow power producers to recoup their costs, which are rising along with fuel prices and currency fluctuation. Gas plants especially struggle as gas supply has been strained, and resources are diverted to heat and away from power. BNEF’s levelized cost estimate for coal power in Turkey is still the lowest across technologies, due to its high capacity factor, but it does not have the same downward trajectory that wind and PV LCOEs have followed in Turkey over the last five years. Financing costs remain high, however, across all technologies, keeping LCOEs from falling as rapidly as in other regions."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Turkey has undertaken ambitious power market reform to privatize and liberalize the sector, and exploit domestic energy resources. This has primarily meant an emphasis on lignite and hydro, as well as renewables. The government plans to add as much as 12.5GW of nuclear capacity by 2030, though only one 4.8GW Russian-backed plant has broken ground, and still is unlikely to be commissioned before 2025. The historic dominance of coal and gas generation is likely to continue, at least in the short term. In the 2017 generation mix coal accounted for 33% and gas 37%. Renewables additions, mainly wind and solar but also geothermal and biomass, are all growing, but face an uncertain future due to lack of clarity on the feed-in tariff."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Turkey continues adding capacity across all technologies, assuming long-term economic growth and increasing power demand, though these assumptions are likely much more optimistic than realistic. The government's prioritization of lignite and emphasis on domestic resources means it is focusing on adding capacity based on energy independence and security of supply rather than just the economics of different technologies. To take advantage of domestic resources, Turkey plans to refit existing coal assets to run off lower-quality domestic lignite rather than imported hard coal – this will help keep costs down and reduce reliance on imported fuel."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Local content requirements for renewables in Turkey are high, but the country benefits from a well-developed value chain in most sectors. Policy risk is currently a major barrier to new project development, as pre-licenses for development are only allocated via auction. Energy policy overall has remained stable as President Erdogan consolidates his hold on power, but associated currency volatility raises offtaker risks. Turkish utilities already have considerable dollar-denominated debt, while distribution companies are required to pay the generous feed-in tariff in dollars as well. While the lira has fallen against the dollar, offtaker risk has grown accordingly. There is a risk of cuts to the feed-in tariff as the cost of the subsidy grows in relative terms."}]}
