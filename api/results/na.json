energy policy","value":"The introduction of feed-in tariffs (Refit program) in 2015 marked the end of Nampowerâ€™s monopoly on electricity generation and the start of renewables investment. In 2015, the state-owned utility signed contracts with 14 IPPs as part of the Refit program, totaling 70MW of renewable projects. The regulator has suggested that Namibia would switch to tenders and unsolicited applications from IPPs, due to the high cost for government of the generous feed-in tariffs. The National Integrated Resource Plan includes a list of renewable energy projects totaling 530MW that it wants to build by 2035. It is unclear whether these projects will be tendered or awarded to unsolicited IPPs. Since 2016, two renewables projects totaling 41MW have been awarded through tenders, while five unsolicited IPPs totaling 74MW have signed a PPA with Nampower."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The PV industry has so far attracted the largest share of clean energy investment (120MW over 5years), while the rest of the share went to two wind projects. Debt has been provided by local Namibian banks, as the PPA tariff is paid in Namibian dollars. On the equity side, projects have attracted a fair share of foreign investors, mainly from South Africa. However, the government introduced ownership rules in 2014 that limit the share held by foreign investors; for example, under the Refit program, at least 30% of the ownership of an IPP project must be allocated to previously disadvantaged Namibians. Meanwhile, high electricity prices are driving investments in off-grid solar battery systems, even in areas where the grid is available. Windhoek alone has an estimated 20MW of off-grid capacity."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"The Electricity Control Board (ECB) sets the electricity tariffs that are cost-reflective, as â€“ unusually for Sub-Saharan Africa â€“ power prices are not subsidized. Hence Nampower is not running on a deficit, unlike most other national utilities in the region. For consumers, however, electricity prices are among the highest in the region and have been increasing by an average of 8% a year over the last five years. This has accelerated the uptake of rooftop PV among households in Namibiaâ€™s major cities. As Namibia relies heavily on imports from the Southern African Power Pool, electricity prices ramp up during peak demand. In order to bring them down, investment is needed in flexible capacity that can be used during peak times."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Namibiaâ€™s electricity generation is dominated by its Ruacana hydropower plant, which accounts for 62% of installed capacity. It relies for almost 60% of its electricity consumption on imports from the Southern African Power Pool. With the desire of becoming more energy independent, Namibia commissioned 78MW of wind and solar capacity in 2015-17. At the moment, Nampower is the only offtaker with which IPPs can sign PPAs. However, the Electricity Control Board (regulator) wants to switch from a single buyer model to a modified single buyer model, where IPPs can sell directly to local distributors and large consumers, and potentially also export power."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Namibia has one of the best solar resources in the world. Thanks to its geographic position and arid climate, a single-axis tracking PV project has a capacity factor as high as 30.2%.  The coastal areas have great wind resources as well. The electrification rate in the urban areas (77%) is much higher than in rural areas (30%). Providing access to the rural population is the biggest challenge in Namibia; being the least densely populated country in Africa, rural areas are very scarcely populated. In these areas, grid extensions are not feasible. Big investments in off-grid systems and mini-grids will be necessary to reach the 50% rural electrification target by 2020. So far, mini-grids have been developed top-down by the government, but the administration is keen to discuss public-private partnership arrangements with investors."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"While local ownership rules in Namibia are restrictive, there is no local content requirement for renewable energy developers, as Namibia does not have a manufacturing industry. Grid problems form a major barrier for renewable energy project development and are related to Nampowerâ€™s monopoly in electricity transmission. Nampower has easy access to imports of baseload electricity from the Southern African Power Pool. It has been slow to adapt its operations to intermittent renewables, as no smart grid management is in place yet. If Nampower does not change its ways of working, it will hinder high renewables penetration. Moreover, the transmission grid is congested, which is a barrier for the development of larger-scale (30-80MW) renewable energy projects."}]}
