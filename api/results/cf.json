energy policy","value":"The Central African Republic has little in the way of implemented or upcoming clean energy policy. Despite the majority of electricity generation coming from hydro plants, there exists no clean energy targets to supplement or maintain these penetration levels. Additionally there are no implemented auctions, feed-in tariffs or other incentives. The electricity cost rates are unrealistically low, driven by the high proportion of the population living below the poverty line, unable to afford electricity, even in the cities. Such low rates means that not only are investors deterred from entering the space due to the low returns, but even the state-owned utility, Enerca, is in a poor financial state."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy investment has neither been a top priority for the state, nor has it been readily available or utilized. The majority, if not all, clean energy financing has come from international development banks. These projects have focused on updating the existing infrastructure and generation assets, rather than expanding the fleet of clean energy production. This is caused by a combination of ongoing conflict within CAR, poor performance from the state-owned utility Enerca, and a lack of policy to implement and support any incoming projects, and financial support."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"The government artificially keeps power prices stable over time –  not through the use of subsidies, but driven by the population’s low electricity usage. This contributes to the poor financial performance of the state-owned utility, and could act as an inhibitor for foreign investment. Compared the Democratic Republic of Congo, industrial and residential electricity prices are similar to those in CAR. But commercial prices are much lower. With regards to technology costs in the country, it is difficult to determine due to the very low pipeline of any capacity additions. The very few projects that have been announced lack detail and are currently on hold due to the ongoing political disturbances which prevent progress from being made."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The large proportion of electricity generation comes from small-hydro systems which have been present on the system for a number of years. These systems are poorly maintained and break down often. There are supplementary diesel-powered generation units but these are small and account for only a few percent of the total installed capacity. There is an interconnection with the Democratic Republic of Congo, but this is inactive due to degradation. Current plans for the future of the electricity generation system include renovating existing generating assets as well as the distribution grids. There are plans to introduce a further 10MW of hydro capacity, but this has stagnated due to the political climate, despite financial support being provided. There is no electricity distribution market as such. Consumers connect to the grid and pay for their usage through the state-owned utility Enerca which dominates the generation, distribution and retail of electricity, despite all three segments being liberalized for competition. There are plans to introduce further laws to facilitate competition, but no plans have been made public."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Electricity demand has been relatively flat. Despite access to electricity rising, primarily in the urban areas, the limited time that there is access to electricity means that actual demand remains flat. Looking forward, as distribution grids and electrification rates improve, this is anticipated to rise. The rate of electrification is highly dependent on the upkeep of the distribution grid and the power plant fleet because outages determine when and where is supplied with electricity. There are programs to modernize the systems, funded primarily by international development banks, although these will not be sufficient to enable wider electrification of the population."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"CAR has no manufacturing capacity for clean energy, nor are there any local content requirements. There are no import duties, tariffs or exemptions for clean energy components or equipment. While the government is considering whether to implement such measures, this is not expected to happen in the near future. The risks are high for developers and asset owners in CAR due to the political unrest. The key barriers are the lack of stability in the market, the absence of major policies to incentivize clean energy growth and a lack of sufficient infrastructure to facilitate such growth."}]}
