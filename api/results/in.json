energy policy","value":"The Indian renewable auctions market is the largest in the world. Auctioned capacity has ramped up by 68% since 2017 as the country moves closer to meeting its goal to install 175GW of renewables by 2022. Indian energy ministers are optimistic about surpassing this target before 2022, with renewables now accounting for 20% of installed capacity. Over 8GW of projects were awarded through auctions in the first half of 2018 alone. India’s solar market almost doubled in size in 2017, making it a record year with annual PV installations touching 8GW. Through various government incentives laid out in the National Solar Mission, India aims to accelerate the growth of solar capacity to reach the target of 100GW by 2022."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"India was the world’s fifth largest clean energy investment market in 2017, jumping up from being the sixth largest in 2016. Clean energy investment totalled $7.4 billion in the first half of 2018, with solar power projects accounting for the majority. Indian companies issued $3.8 billion of green bonds in 2017 and issuances are expected to increase further as lenders and IPPs look to raise cheaper funds to meet their capital requirements. More recently, IPPs are starting to tap into public markets and private equity funding to raise capital. BNEF expects overall clean energy asset financing to surpass $12 billion in 2018."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Retail electricity tariffs in India have been rising, with residential tariffs, which are subsidized by commercial and industrial consumers, hit the hardest. In 2017, Gujarat was the only state where electricity prices declined, and that was because of the strong financial health of distribution utilities. Through auctions, India has discovered some of the lowest tariffs in the world. Expectations of a drop in PV module prices due to demand-side shocks from China drove the lowest tariffs to 2,440 Indian rupees/MWh in July 2018 auctions. Furthermore, wind power prices dropped below the cheapest solar prices, to a record low of 2,430 rupees/MWh in December 2017. LCOEs have been pushed lower with increased competition amongst IPPs in auctions and high capacity utilization factors."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The Indian power sector is unbundled and generation of power is handled by federal government-owned companies, state and private sector companies. Installed generating capacity was 346GW in June 2018, with renewables (excluding large hydro) accounting for 71GW. With coal taking a share of almost 60%, challenges with domestic coal supply are resulting in increased coal imports. Nevertheless, the government has reduced its coal capacity target for 2027 by 11GW to 238GW as the country seeks to replace coal with renewables through auctions. The UDAY (Ujjwal DISCOM Assurance Yojna) debt-restructuring program has been successful at overcoming some issues faced by financially distressed distribution companies. Now, more than 90% of the country’s electricity is covered by the program and companies in Gujarat, Chhattisgarh and Haryana have turned profitable according to the Indian Ministry of Power."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"India’s total electricity demand is expected to increase by 76% between 2017 and 2027 as per the Central Electricity Authority. Peak demand is forecast to grow 85% in the same period. India's economy achieved 7.1% real annual growth in 2017. High inflation has caused a rise in benchmark lending rates. Furthermore, recent currency depreciation has increased pressure on domestic solar developers that import equipment from China. The government achieved 100% village electrification in April 2018, though around 25 million households remain un-electrified. BNEF expects this village electrification scheme to increase India’s annual electricity demand by approximately 2% from the current level in the short term."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Land acquisition and transmission connectivity are two recurring challenges faced by developers in India. Due to this, IPPs have been requesting the government to extend deadlines for projects won in auctions. Aside from the cost of debt increasing and a depreciating rupee, cost pressures have further increased with the government's decision to impose safeguard duties on solar PV cells and modules. This is expected to trigger a series of renegotiations to revise realized tariffs in recent auctions and slow down solar rooftop projects."}]}
