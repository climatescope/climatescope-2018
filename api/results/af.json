energy policy","value":"Afghanistan aims to develop 4.5-5GW of renewables capacity by 2032, as set out in the country’s Renewable Energy Policy. The targets are divided into two terms – the first (2015-20) envisages creating a favorable environment for the growth of renewables, and the second (2020-32) is when the capacity targets will be achieved. Going by current progress, the targets are very ambitious – the country is halfway through Term 1 and has made little headway in its goals for that period. There are no feed-in tariffs, subsidies, rules or regulations for the renewable energy sector – all of which were goals for this period."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"All the renewable energy projects in the country have been fully supported by international donors, with the World Bank being the biggest contributor. The government by itself is not able to secure financing for these projects yet. Most investments have been made in the hydropower sector, followed by solar. There hasn’t been much private sector involvement yet. However, the first segment of the Renewable Energy Policy had set goals to provide incentives such as interest subsidies, soft loans and tax exemptions to increase the private sector participation."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Electricity prices in Afghanistan are highly volatile as the country relies heavily on imports to meet its needs. Over the last few years the national utility has hiked prices as the U.S. dollar has appreciated against the afghani. Afghanistan spends more than $200 million each year to import electricity from neighboring countries. The national utility, however, believes that once the country is able to harness its own resources, prices will come down again. When this will be achieved is unclear."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Afghanistan relies heavily on energy imports. About 80% of the country’s power needs are met by imports, hydro power being the dominant source of energy that is imported. The country has the potential to generate 318GW of electricity from renewable sources, with 23GW coming from hydro, 67GW from wind, 222GW from solar and 2GW from geothermal, as per the Renewable Energy Policy 2015. So far, only parts of some hydroelectric projects have been implemented. The power market currently is controlled by Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat and there is not much participation from the private sector. Term 1 of the Renewable Energy Policy focuses on creating an environment that encourages investments from private sector. This involves setting up transparent regulations, tariff guidelines, tax based incentives, freedom to sell power to third part, leasing, licensing incentives, etc"},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand for Afghanistan is largely met by imports – neighboring countries account for some 80% of the country’s power needs. Power demand is expected to rise in the future, but imports are not considered a reliable source to meet these needs, mainly because of political instability in the region. Policies have been set in place to harness the country’s potential to exploit its own hydroelectric, solar and wind resources. There has been progress in increasing the electrification rate within the country – rural electrification now stands at 78%, and urban electrification is at 98%."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The energy sector in Afghanistan faces issues such as funding gaps, a lack of expertise, a lack of reliable historical data, weak public awareness about environmental issues, high interest rates (almost 15% as compared to less than 5% in European countries), and security concerns that result in high premiums for installing and commissioning projects. Moreover, DABS charges almost four times more for electricity produced through off-grid plants because of higher generation costs. Also, there is no offtaker that is obliged to purchase the electricity from renewables projects, which discourages the use of off-grid electricity and increases the offtaker risk."}]}
