energy policy","value":"The U.A.E. has set itself the goal of reaching a 50% share of renewable energy in the generation mix by 2050. Given the federal structure of the country, individual emirates have each determined their own objectives. Abu Dhabi and Dubai are shooting for 7% by 2020; both have also put renewables projects up for bidding. Dubai, for instance, issues tenders for renewables projects as part of its Clean Energy Strategy 2050, which aims to source 75% of power generation from clean energy by this century’s halfway point. Despite the U.A.E.’s reputation as a regional trailblazer for clean energy, the country has not put in place any renewables incentives – progress to date has largely been driven by state-backed projects."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Investment in renewables has been considerable – $400 million went towards funding solar plants in 2017 alone. Spending is set to skyrocket: the U.A.E. has pledged $163 billion in spending on renewables by 2050. Home-grown players such as Masdar have led a number of consortiums heading the country’s main projects, such as the Shams Power solar thermal plant, commissioned in 2013 and owned by the Abu Dhabi-based developer (80%) and Total (20%). The project was underwritten to the tune of $600 million by a group of 10 foreign and domestic banks, underlining the extent to which sources of finance are diversified. International developers, investors and banks have invested considerable sums in the country’s renewable energy initiatives."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"U.A.E. solar tenders have attracted headlines for record low tariffs: June 2016 saw the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA), one of four national utilities, announce the $29/MWh price agreed on with the Masdar-led grouping chosen to complete the 800MW third phase of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park. This project will bring 5,000MW online by 2030 at a cost of $13.6 billion. The project’s fourth stage, adding 700MW of solar thermal capacity, was awarded to a consortium of Chinese and Saudi investors with a 35-year PPA price of $0.073/kWh – by far the lowest for the technology. Retail electricity tariffs are the Gulf’s highest and are independently set by the four utilities."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Installed renewables capacity – mostly solar – has grown swiftly over the past five years, rising from 14MW in 2012 to 351MW in 2017. Yet generation is still dominated by hydrocarbons: oil and natural gas account for well over 99% of the current output. A growing project pipeline is set to increase the share of renewables – the Ministry of Energy has set its sights on issuing tenders at a rate of 1GW a year until 2050. Ongoing projects include a 1.17GW PV plant in Abu Dhabi, the construction of which started in 2017. Four utilities have a monopoly on procurement, transmission and distribution. Generation is, however, open to private participation: over 90% of Abu Dhabi’s generation is provided by IPPs."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Peak demand has gone up significantly over the last few years, with an increase of nearly 5,000MW over the last half-decade. This trend is set to continue with the U.A.E.’s continuing economic and population growth. With high irradiation rates, the country has considerable solar potential. Frequent power cuts in the poorer emirates are a thing of the past, and the population is geographically concentrated and connected to the grid – 85% of Emiratis live in the emirates of Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah. Existing thermal plants are well-maintained and the country’s business environment is generally favorable, with a high degree of clarity regarding the rules and procedures underpinning energy projects."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Renewable energy projects face few hurdles in the U.A.E. The sector benefits from strong political support, with the state positioning itself as the regional champion of renewable energy by hosting the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and underwriting domestic heavyweights such as Masdar. Offtaker risk is low and there is little chance of curtailment presenting an issue. Efforts are being made to interconnect transmission networks run by the four power authorities with a view to improving the grid’s ability to cope with increased intermittency once solar generation begins ramping up."}]}
