energy policy","value":"Despite a PPP law, a renewable energy act and import-duty exemptions for solar components that are all at various stages along the legislative pipeline, Sudan has no clean energy incentives. Nor has the country exhibited clarity concerning its ambitions in this area. In addition to the country’s plan for renewables to account for 20% of generation by 2030 as part of its nationally determined contribution, presentations given by officials have cited a goal of 500MW by 2020. These targets, however, have not been explicitly issued as national objectives by the government. Official or not, with no utility-scale renewables commissioned to date, their realization appears a distant prospect."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Difficulties in securing finance are first and foremost among the challenges facing developers. No domestic banks offer loans to developers investing in clean power, and years of international isolation coupled with crippling debts (the World Bank puts Sudan’s arrears at $50 billion) have left international financial institutions reluctant to bankroll renewable energy projects. Difficulties in attracting donors have translated into a lack of utility-scale renewables build-out. Although several projects have been announced, including a 100MW wind farm with a predicted cost of $217 million, all have struggled to secure funding. Investments have been limited to rural electrification schemes, with the United Nations Development Program and the government implementing separate initiatives to expand energy access through distributed renewables."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Sudanese consumers benefit from generous electricity subsidies which result in some of the world's lowest retail prices. A reduced “social tariff” benefits those whose consumption amounts to less than 200kWh/month, a higher threshold than is found elsewhere in the region. Prices have increased in recent years, but only for higher consumption bands. While the peculiarities of the procurement arrangement should be taken into account (see below for details), Sudan’s sole IPP has its generation purchased by the state-owned offtaker at $50/MWh."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The structure of the power sector has evolved in recent years. Following the unbundling of the sector at the turn of the millennium, 2016 saw the creation of the Sudanese Electricity Holding Co. With an effective monopoly on procurement, the holding company oversees two generation utilities – the Sudanese Thermal Power Generating company and its hydro-focused counterpart – as well as two companies whose respective remits cover distribution and transmission. Though the 2001 Electricity Law opened up private participation throughout the energy sector, the above actors are state-owned. The aforementioned IPP operates a 26.5MW thermal plant, yet the arrangement can only be loosely referred to as a PPA as the fuel used is provided by the thermal utility free of charge."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"While optimism abounded following the removal of U.S. sanctions in October 2017, inflation has since surged, widening the chasm between production costs and already rock-bottom power prices. Economic hardship will persist in the wake of a sharp currency devaluation on October 7, 2018. Yet Sudan’s geography is well suited to renewables. The country’s assets include high solar irradiation and strong winds. Future energy demand will be met by ongoing electrification initiatives – population growth outstrips the 100,000-odd new customers connected to the grid each year by a considerable margin. Moreover, the state’s balance sheets are ravaged by its reliance on diesel, the scarcity of which has boosted both the cost of thermal power production and the attractiveness of renewables."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Developers entering the Sudanese market are faced with a number of obstacles, such as the domestic security situation: the country’s western and southern regions remain unstable. In addition to high capex costs due to country risk, import duties on solar equipment are high, reaching rates of as much as 60%. As with other countries in the region, matters are not helped by low customer confidence in PV systems stemming from a lack of reputable solar companies in the market. The devolution of grid extensions to regional authorities impedes long-term planning and affords little visibility on future transmission projects, which ultimately leads to them being completed in a haphazard manner."}]}
