energy policy","value":"Ethiopia, Africa's fastest growing economy, already meets all of its electricity needs from renewable sources, and its generating capacity mix is mostly hydro. Ethiopia has plans to add another nearly 10GW of hydro and 3GW of other renewables by 2020. However, this ambitious target has not been accompanied by effective policy mechanisms. Ethiopia has tendered both wind and solar projects, including through an ongoing Scaling Solar tender, but in a lengthy process that has still not resulted in capacity being commissioned. The private sector has until now been involved in ad hoc negotiations for PPAs with Ethiopia Electric Power (EEP), the state-owned power producer. Ethiopia is overhauling its public-private partnership regulations in order to attract IPPs, though this process is still in its early stages. Without more concrete incentives, the country will fall short of its 2020 aims."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"New investment in clean energy in Ethiopia has been episodic, with jumps in investment corresponding to specific large-scale projects. After a geothermal financing in 2015, no new investment was seen until May 2018, when the Assela wind farm reached financial close through concessional funding from Denmark. Generating capacity is increasing rapidly, but much of the development is still driven by the government and by EEP. Large-scale investment, especially in hydro, has also come from China. Geothermal has also attracted considerable investment, in both resource exploration and project development."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Power prices in Ethiopia are subsidized below a cost-reflective level. Due to its fully renewable power mix however, generation costs are fairly low – considerably lower than its neighbors – as they are not exposed to fuel prices. The government has plans to introduce cost-reflective electricity tariffs in order to improve the financial health of the EEP. These plans were adopted the Council of Ministers in August 2018, and will be the first tariff adjustment in 13 years."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Ethiopia's power mix is dominated by hydro, which makes up more than 90% of the generation mix. While some hydro-reliant countries have struggled with drought, Ethiopia has mostly avoided the issue, with the most recent severe drought in 2008-09. However, it is a potential vulnerability for future security of supply. Wind makes up around 7% of generation, and the government aims to continue developing that sector. Ethiopia has not held large-scale competitive auctions yet, which tend to drive down prices. In terms of market structure, in 2013 the vertically integrated EEPCo was split into the EEP, which is responsible for generation and transmission; and the Ethiopian Electric Utility (EEU), which looks after distribution and sales."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand is expected to grow as Ethiopia is Africa's fastest growing economy. The government is also prioritizing electrification, and aims for universal access by 2025, which would further increase power demand. Ethiopia has strong wind and solar resources, which it intends to exploit, while remaining fully committed to hydro. It is continuing work on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam megaproject, which would add 6GW of power to the mix when commissioned, although it is already well behind schedule. Ethiopia intends to add more large hydro projects, as well as more capacity across nearly all renewables technologies. No regulations prohibit corporate PPAs, but so far all generation is purchased by EEP."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"One major barrier to renewables development in Ethiopia is financing difficulties. The country has a serious shortage of foreign currency reserves, which make raising financing difficult. There are also no sovereign guarantees on offtake payments. Offtaker risk has not yet been a problem in Ethiopia, but EEP is struggling financially and IPPs may be hesitant to enter into long-term contracts. Renewables components are exempt from import duties and VAT, in theory, but in practice getting items through customs can be cumbersome and slow."}]}
