energy policy","value":"Kuwait's 2030 Energy Strategy sets out to secure 15% of electricity generation from renewable sources by 2030. This target is to be achieved through a combination of solar (both PV and solar thermal) and onshore wind. Kuwait has only recently started to develop and deploy renewable technologies, and the energy mix remains largely hydrocarbon-based, but there are many projects in the pipeline to increase the share of renewables in generation and lessen the countryâ€™s dependence on fossil fuels. An illustrative example is the 1.5GW Al-Dibdibah solar project, with a tender submission deadline set for December 16, 2018. Most renewables capacity is under development at the Shagaya Renewable Energy Park, which will have the capacity to house 2GW of renewables by 2030. This would displace nearly 12.5 million barrels of oil for electricity generation per year."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The deployment of renewables started very recently in Kuwait, translating into high growth rates from a very small base. The bulk of renewable generation is solar (both PV and solar thermal), with onshore wind accounting for the rest. No other renewable energy technologies are set to be developed, but some hybrid projects are in planning. The country does not have financial institutions solely dedicated to green investments, but domestic banks have been active in financing energy projects, namely the first phase of the Az Zour North Natural Gas Power and Water Plant. Still, the concept of project finance is quite new and the vast majority of renewable projects under development have secured funding from foreign companies."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Electricity prices in Kuwait are amongst the lowest in the Middle East and North Africa, due to heavily subsidized fossil-fuel generation. These subsidies distort the allocation of resources by encouraging excessive consumption, accelerating the depletion of natural resources and undermining the growth potential of renewables. In order to curb this, the government increased electricity prices for expatriates living in Kuwait. Effective September 2017, the flat rate of 2 fils/kWh (0.7 U.S. cents/kWh) changed to a three-block tariff of 5 fils/kWh, 10 fils/kWh and 15 fils/kWh for consumption ranges of 0-1,000kWh, 1,001-2,000kWh and above 2,001kWh, respectively. However, Kuwaiti citizens were exempt from the increase. Electricity prices in the commercial sector increased to 25 fils/kWh, while industrial prices remained flat at 1 fils/kWh. There are no further plans to increase prices."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Kuwaitâ€™s electric power system is vertically integrated and the Ministry of Electricity and Water (MEW) is responsible for all activities in the power sector. Fossil fuels account for the bulk of the generation mix, with renewables representing less than 5%. Still, the country is committed to increasing this share to 15% by 2030 and a number of projects are under way to meet this goal. The Kuwait Authority for Partnership Projects oversees the development of PPAs according to law 116 of 2014. However, there is little experience in this area. The first phase of the Az-Zour North project was the first IPP in Kuwait, but the model is yet to be refined so it can provide a benchmark for future developments."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Electricity consumption is growing at approximately 8% a year, which means capacity needs to double every decade to meet demand. This is the result of several factors, namely wasteful resource consumption on the back of heavily subsidized energy prices, population growth, and a nascent petrochemical industry. By 2017, renewables accounted for a negligible 1% of capacity, but Kuwaitâ€™s abundant solar and wind resources offer the potential for a quick ramp-up. Kuwaitâ€™s solar global horizontal irradiance is at 1,900kWh/m2/year, according to Irena, while the potential for wind stands at as much as 1,605 hours/year. Although no explicit fleet modernization program has been announced, Kuwait is building capacity in response to the forecast growth in electricity demand."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Kuwait has a very stable government; law is transparent and often available in English; and the country maintains a strong credit rating, with high liquidity in the domestic banking sector. The government is striving to attract foreign investment as a way to grow the local economy, create jobs, and promote technology transfer. However, the effort to grow the share of renewables in generation lacks a consolidated approach. Effort fragmentation is common, with the work split between research institutes, the government and the private sector, which undermines the development of a national strategy to meet the countryâ€™s energy target."}]}
