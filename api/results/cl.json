energy policy","value":"Chileâ€™s exceptional natural resources, stable government and healthy economy make it attractive to clean energy investment. The government has set ambitious long-term goals for adding clean energy capacity and begun implementing policies to foster an environment in which renewable projects are more competitive. Targets include a clean energy mandate of 20% of generation for utilities by 2025 and an overall clean energy target of 60% of generation by 2035. By 2050, the country aims to have 70% renewables generation from its electricity mix.\nChile plans to auction a total of 12.2TWh/year by 2022. Auctions are technology-blind, with wind, solar, gas and other technologies competing head-to-head. In 2014, the government implemented a new system that created a more competitive environment for clean technologies. Since then, Chile has held four tenders and contracted 31TWh/year. In two of the last three tenders, renewables accounted for 100% of all generation contracted. \nIn January 2018, coal asset owners signed an agreement committing to not invest in new coal plants. Coordinated by the government, the four generators with coal assets and other players are working on a decarbonization plan that aims to retire or convert all coal plants by 2040."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Chile recorded $10 billion of clean energy investment between 2013 and year-end 2017. The country has many types of financial organizations investing in renewables, including development and commercial banks. The U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) has been the main lead arranger in the country, injecting $557 million into PV assets over the period. For distributed generation, however, it is a different scenario. Although distributed PV generation has expanded strongly in 2018 (from 12MW in January to 20MW in September), the lack of cheap financing, as well as bureaucracy, remain obstacles for the sector."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"In Chile, spot prices are determined by the node of delivery, which takes into account the marginal operating costs of nodal plants, as well as nodal demand. Wholesale prices have shown high volatility in recent years, especially in the north of SIC sub-system. In 2017, SIC prices slipped to zero at times during midday, while shooting back to $60/MWh at night. The tariff is based on peak load pricing, where consumers pay a price according to the demand. Average national commercial, industrial and residential tariffs were $214/MWh, $149/MWh and $199/MWh, respectively, in 2017."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Chile has a National Electric System (Sistema ElÃ©ctrico Nacional, or SEN) as well as two smaller isolated systems in the south of the country, the Sistema ElÃ©ctrico de AysÃ©n (SEA) and Sistema ElÃ©ctrico de Magallanes (SEM). SEN was created with the connection of the countryâ€™s two primary power systems, the Sistema Interconectado del Norte Grande (SING) and the Sistema Interconectado Central (SIC), at the end of 2017. The process of interconnection is ongoing. The SIC and SING sub-systems together account for 99% of Chileâ€™s total installed capacity, with 18GW and 6GW installed, respectively. In November 2017, a SIC-SING interconnection was commissioned via a 600-kilometer transmission line. Ahead of that, the SING and SIC system operators merged.  \nIn 2017, Chile had 1.9GW of solar and 1.3GW of wind capacity, representing 13% of total installed capacity and renewable assets represented 24% of all energy generated. Wind generation in Chile surged from 1.4TWh in 2014 to 3.5TWh in 2017, while solar output spiked from 0.5TWh to 3.9TWh. Together, wind and solar represented 9.4% of the countryâ€™s total power generation in 2017, up from virtually nothing five years ago."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Chile is the worldâ€™s largest copper exporter, and the energy-intensive nature of that industry creates substantial power demand. In 2016, the copper industry alone accounted for 8% of Chileâ€™s total GDP and 51% of exports. In a given year, the mining industry consumes an average of 30% of the total power generated in the country. Mining operations are located in the northern part of the country and mostly served by the SING system. The majority of coal assets are also located in this region, in addition to the greatest potential for solar generation in the country. However, the lack of interconnection between SIC and SING has historically driven the majority of solar developments to the SIC system, where over 90% of the population lives and most of the retail demand is located. This reality might change, however, as the government increasingly focuses on integration of the two sub-systems and on building connections with neighboring countries."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The main barrier for renewables development remains insufficient interconnection between the two sub-systems. Interconnection is critical for enabling solar energy, in particular, produced in the northern SING sub-system and home to the best solar resources, to flow to the center of the country, where population and demand are concentrated. Curtailment of renewables began in Chile in August 2015. Since then, wind and solar power have been curtailed at increasing rates, though progress is being made on development of new transmission infrastructure aimed at easing this. In addition to the SIC-SING interconnection commissioned in 2017, Chile is building the 550kV Cardones-Polpaico transmission line that will also connect the two systems, expected to be commissioned by December 2018."}]}
